@begin{Ramification}
This definition of visible part does not apply to generic formal
packages @em @RefSecNum{Formal Packages} defines
the visible part of a generic formal package.

The implicit empty private part is important because certain
implicit declarations occur there if the package is a child package,
and it defines types in its visible part that are derived from,
or contain as components, private types declared within the
parent package. These implicit declarations are visible
in children of the child package.
See @RefSecNum(Compilation Units - Library Units).
@end{Ramification}

@redundant[An entity declared in the private part of a package is visible
only within the declarative region of the package itself
(including any child units @em
see @RefSecNum{Compilation Units - Library Units}).
In contrast, expanded names denoting
entities declared in the visible part can be used even outside the
package; furthermore, direct visibility of such entities can be
achieved by means of @nt{use_clause}s
(see @RefSecNum{Selected Components} and @RefSecNum{Use Clauses}).]
@end{StaticSem}

@begin{RunTime}
@PDefn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(package_declaration)}
The elaboration of a @nt{package_declaration} consists of the elaboration of
its @nt{basic_declarative_item}s in the given order.
@end{RunTime}

@begin{Notes}
The visible part of a package contains all the information that
another program unit is able to know about the package.

If a declaration occurs immediately within the specification
of a package, and the declaration has a corresponding completion that
is a body,
then that body has to occur immediately within the body of
the package.
@begin{TheProof}
This follows from the fact that the declaration and completion are
required to occur
immediately within the same declarative region,
and the fact that @ntf{bodies} are disallowed (by the @SyntaxName@;s)
in @nt{package_specification}s.
This does not apply to instances of generic units,
whose bodies can occur in @nt{package_specification}s.

@begin{Incompatible83}
@Defn{incompatibilities with Ada 83}
In Ada 83, a library package is allowed to have a body even if
it doesn't need one.
In Ada 95, a library package body is either
required or forbidden @em never optional.
The workaround is to add @key[pragma] Elaborate_Body,
or something else requiring a body,
to each library package that has a body that isn't otherwise
required.

RM83-7.1, @lquotes@;Package Structure@rquotes@;, which we have removed.

RM83 was unclear on the rules about when a package requires a body.
For example, RM83-7.1(4) and RM83-7.1(8) clearly forgot about the
case of an incomplete type declared in a @nt{package_declaration} but
completed in the body.
In addition,
RM83 forgot to make this rule apply to a generic package.
We have corrected these rules.
Finally, since we now allow a @nt{pragma} Import for any explicit
declaration, the completion rules need to take this into account as
well.

In any @nt{package_body} without @nt{statement}s

@Redundant[(For an instance, the implicit @nt{package_@!body}

For a library package, the place is partially determined by the
elaboration dependences (see @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Program Structure and Compilation Issues}).)]
@begin{Discussion}
Thus, for example, we can refer to something happening just
after the @key{begin} of a @nt{package_body},
and we can refer to the @nt{handled_sequence_of_statements}
of a @nt{package_body},
without worrying about all the optional pieces.
The place of the implicit body makes a difference for tasks
activated by the package.
See also RM83-9.3(5).

The implicit body would be illegal if explicit in the case of a library
package that does not require (and therefore does not allow)
a body.
This is a bit strange, but not harmful.

@begin{RunTime}
@PDefn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(nongeneric package_body)}
For the elaboration of a nongeneric @nt{package_body},
its @nt{declarative_@!part} is first
elaborated, and its @nt{handled_@!sequence_of_@!statements} is then executed.
@end{RunTime}

@begin{Notes}
A variable declared in the body of a package is only visible
within this body and, consequently, its value can only be
changed within the @nt{package_body}. In the absence of local tasks,
the value of such a variable remains unchanged between calls issued
from outside the package to subprograms declared in the visible part.
The properties of such a variable are similar to those of a @lquotes@;static@rquotes@;
variable of C.

The elaboration of the body of a subprogram explicitly declared
in the visible part of a package is caused by the elaboration of the
body of the package. Hence a call of such a subprogram by an
outside program unit raises the exception Program_Error if the call
takes place before the elaboration of the
@nt{package_body} (see @RefSecNum{Declarative Parts}).

@begin{DiffWord83}
The syntax rule for @nt{package_body} now uses the syntactic category
@nt{handled_sequence_of_statements}.

The @nt{declarative_part} of a @nt{package_body} is now required;
that doesn't make any real difference,
since a @nt{declarative_part} can be empty.

RM83 seems to have forgotten to say that a @nt{package_body} can't
stand alone, without a previous declaration.
We state that rule here.

RM83 forgot to restrict the definition of elaboration of
@ntf{package_bodies} to nongeneric ones.
We have corrected that omission.

The rule about implicit bodies (from RM83-9.3(5))
is moved here, since it is more generally applicable.

Thus, neither the declaration

the full declaration of the type.
Similarly, before the full declaration, the name of the partial view

@begin{TheProof}
  This rule is stated officially in
  @RefSec{Completions of Declarations}.

no derivatives of the partial view are allowed within the immediate
scope of the partial view;
@Redundant[derivatives of the full view are allowed.]
@begin{Ramification}
Note that deriving from a partial view within its immediate scope
can only occur in a package that is a child of the one where the partial
view is declared.
The rule implies that in the visible part of a public child package,
it is impossible to derive from an untagged private type declared in the
visible part of the parent package in the case where the full
view of the parent type turns out to be tagged.
We considered a model in which the derived type was implicitly
redeclared at the earliest place within its immediate scope where
characteristics needed to be added.
However, we rejected that model, because (1) it would imply that (for an
untagged type) subprograms explicitly declared after the derived type
could be inherited, and (2) to make this model work for composite types
as well, several implicit redeclarations would be
needed, since new characteristics can become visible one by one;
that seemed like too much mechanism.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Discussion}
  The rule for tagged partial views
  is redundant for partial views that are private extensions,
  since all extensions of a given ancestor tagged type are tagged,
  and limited if the ancestor is limited.
  We phrase this rule partially redundantly to keep its structure parallel
  with the other rules.

@begin{Discussion}
@Defn{generic contract/private type contract analogy}
Packages with private types are analogous to generic packages with
formal private types,
as follows:
The declaration of a package-private type is like the declaration of
a formal private type.
The visible part of the package is like the generic formal part;
these both specify a contract (that is, a set of operations and other
things available for the private type).
The private part of the package is like an instantiation of the generic;
they both give a @nt{full_type_declaration} that specifies implementation
details of the private type.
The clients of the package are like the body of the generic;
usage of the private type in these places is restricted to the
operations defined by the contract.

In other words, being inside the package is like being outside the
generic, and being outside the package is like being inside the
generic;
a generic is like an @lquotes@;inside-out@rquotes@; package.

This analogy also works for private extensions
in the same inside-out way.

Many of the legality rules are defined with this analogy in mind.
See, for example, the rules relating to operations of [formal]
derived types.

The completion rules for a private
type are intentionally quite similar to the matching rules for a
generic formal private type.

This analogy breaks down in one respect:
a generic actual subtype is a subtype,
whereas the full view for a private type is always a new type.
(We considered allowing the completion of a @nt{private_type_declaration}
to be a @nt{subtype_declaration},
but the semantics just won't work.)
This difference is behind the fact that a generic actual type can be
class-wide, whereas the completion of a private type always declares
a specific type.

The syntax for a @nt{private_type_declaration} is augmented to

In Ada 83, a private type without discriminants cannot be completed
with a type with discriminants.
Ada 95 allows the full view to have discriminants,
so long as they have defaults
(that is, so long as the first subtype is definite).
This change is made for uniformity with generics,
and because the rule as stated is simpler and easier to remember
than the Ada 83 rule.
In the original version of Ada 83, the same restriction applied
to generic formal private types.
However, the restriction was removed by the ARG for generics.
In order to maintain the @lquotes@;generic contract/private type contract analogy@rquotes@;
discussed above, we have to apply the same rule to
package-private types.
Note that a private untagged type without discriminants can be
completed with a tagged type with discriminants only if the
full view is constrained, because discriminants of tagged types
cannot have defaults.

The predefined operators that exist for a given type are determined by
the classes to which the type belongs.
For example, an integer type has a predefined "+" operator.
In most cases, the predefined operators of a type are declared
immediately after the definition of the type;
the exceptions are explained below.
Inherited subprograms are also implicitly declared
immediately after the definition of the type,
except as stated below.

For a composite type, the characteristics
(see @RefSecNum{Private Types and Private Extensions})
of the type are determined in part by the
characteristics of its component types.
At the place where the composite type is declared,
the only characteristics of component types used are those
characteristics visible at that place.
If later @Chg{New=[immediately within the declarative region in which the
composite type is declared],

@begin{Discussion}
The above rules matter only when the component type (or parent type) is
declared in the visible part of a package, and the composite type (or
derived type) is declared within the declarative region of that package
(possibly in a nested package or a child package).

@leading@keepnext@;Consider:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] Parent @key[is]
    @key[type] Root @key[is] @key[tagged] @key[null] @key[record];
    @key[procedure] Op1(X : Root);

    @key[type] My_Int @key[is] @key[range] 1..10;
@key[private]
    @key[procedure] Op2(X : Root);

    @key[type] Another_Int @key[is] @key[new] My_Int;
    @key[procedure] Int_Op(X : My_Int);
@key[end] Parent;

@key[with] Parent; @key[use] Parent;
@key[package] Unrelated @key[is]
    @key[type] T2 @key[is] @key[new] Root @key[with] @key[null] @key[record];
    @key[procedure] Op2(X : T2);
@key[end] Unrelated;

@key[package] Parent.Child @key[is]
    @key[type] T3 @key[is] @key[new] Root @key[with] @key[null] @key[record];
    --@RI{ Op1(T3) implicitly declared here.}

    @key[package] Nested @key[is]
        @key[type] T4 @key[is] @key[new] Root @key[with] @key[null] @key[record];
    @key[private]
        ...
    @key[end] Nested;
@key[private]
    --@RI{ Op2(T3) implicitly declared here.}
    ...
@key[end] Parent.Child;

@key[with] Unrelated; @key[use] Unrelated;
@key[package] @key[body] Parent.Child @key[is]
    @key[package] @key[body] Nested @key[is]
        --@RI{ Op2(T4) implicitly declared here.}
    @key[end] Nested;

    @key[type] T5 @key[is] @key[new] T2 @key[with] @key[null] @key[record];
@key[end] Parent.Child;
@end{Example}

Another_Int does not inherit Int_Op,
because Int_Op does not @lquotes@;exist@rquotes@; at the place
where Another_Int is declared.

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}
Type T2 inherits Op1 and Op2 from Root.
However, the inherited Op2 is never declared,
because Parent.Op2 is never visible @Chg{New=[immediately within the declarative region],
Old=[within the immediate scope]} of T2.
T2 explicitly declares its own Op2,
but this is unrelated to the inherited one @em it
does not override the inherited one,
and occupies a different slot in the type descriptor.

T3 inherits both Op1 and Op2. Op1 is implicitly declared immediately
after the type declaration,
whereas Op2 is declared at the beginning of the private part.
Note that if Child were a private child of Parent,
then Op1 and Op2 would both be implicitly declared immediately after the
type declaration.

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}
T4 is similar to T3, except that the earliest place
@Chg{New=[immediately within the declarative region containing T4],
Old=[within T4's immediate scope]}
where Root's Op2 is visible is in the body of Nested.

If T3 or T4 were to declare a type-conformant Op2,
this would override the one inherited from Root.
This is different from the situation with T2.


T5 inherits Op1 and two Op2's from T2.
Op1 is implicitly declared immediately after the declaration of T5,
as is the Op2 that came from Unrelated.Op2.
However, the Op2 that originally came from Parent.Op2 is never
implicitly declared for T5,
since T2's version of that Op2 is never visible (anywhere @em it never
got declared either).

For all of these rules, implicit private parts and bodies are assumed as
needed.

@leading@keepnext@;It is possible for characteristics of a type to be revealed

@leading@Redundant[The Class attribute is defined for tagged subtypes in

@end(description)

@end{StaticSem}

@begin{Notes}
Because a partial view and a full view
are two different views of one and the same type,
outside of the defining package the characteristics of the type are
those defined by the visible part.
Within these outside program units the type is just a private type
or private extension,
and any language rule that applies only to another class of types
does not apply. The fact that the full declaration might implement
a private type with a type of a particular class (for example, as
an array type) is relevant only
within the declarative region of the package itself
including any child units.

@NoPrefix@;The consequences of this actual implementation are, however, valid
everywhere. For example: any default initialization of components
takes place; the attribute Size provides the size of the full view;
finalization is still done for controlled components of the full view;
task dependence rules still apply to components that are task
objects.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00287-01]}
Partial views provide @Chg{Version=[2],New=[initialization],
Old=[assignment (unless the view is limited)]},
membership tests, selected components for the selection of
discriminants and inherited components, qualification,
and explicit conversion.@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ Nonlimited partial views
also allow use of @nt{assignment_statement}s.],Old=[]}

For a subtype S of a partial view, S'Size is defined
(see @RefSecNum{Operational and Representation Attributes}).
For an object A of a partial view,
the attributes A'Size and A'Address are defined
(see @RefSecNum{Operational and Representation Attributes}).
The Position, First_Bit, and Last_Bit attributes
are also defined for discriminants and inherited components.

@i{Notes on the example:}
Outside of the package Key_Manager, the operations available for

not include other relational operators such as ">=", or arithmetic
operators.

@NoPrefix@;The explicitly declared operator "<" hides the predefined operator
"<" implicitly declared by the @nt{full_type_declaration}. Within the
body of the function, an explicit conversion of X and Y to the

type.
Alternatively, the result of the function could be written as not (X
>= Y), since the operator ">=" is not redefined.

remains unchanged between calls of the procedure Get_Key. (See also

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
In Ada 83, a deferred constant is required to be of a private type
declared in the same visible part.
This restriction is removed for Ada 95;
deferred constants can be of any type.

In Ada 83, a deferred constant declaration was not permitted to
include a constraint, nor the reserved word @key(aliased).

In Ada 83, the rules required conformance of type marks; here
we require static matching of subtypes if the deferred constant
is constrained.

A deferred constant declaration can be completed with a @nt{pragma}
Import. Such a deferred constant declaration need not be within a
@nt{package_specification}.

The rules for too-early uses of deferred constants are modified in
Ada 95 to allow more cases, and catch all errors at compile time.
This change is necessary in order to allow deferred constants of a
tagged type without violating the principle that for a dispatching call,
there is always an implementation to dispatch to.
It has the beneficial side effect of catching some Ada-83-erroneous
programs at compile time.
The new rule fits in well with the new freezing-point rules.
Furthermore, we are trying to convert undefined-value problems into
bounded errors, and we were having trouble for the case of deferred
constants.
Furthermore, uninitialized deferred constants cause trouble for the
shared variable / tasking rules, since they are really variable, even
though they purport to be constant.
In Ada 95, they cannot be touched until they become constant.

Note that we do not consider this change to be an upward
incompatibility, because it merely changes an erroneous execution in Ada
83 into a compile-time error.

The Ada 83 semantics are unclear in the case where
the full view turns out to be an access type.
It is a goal of the language design to prevent uninitialized access
objects.
One wonders if the implementation is required to initialize the
deferred constant to null, and then initialize it (again!) to its
real value.
In Ada 95, the problem goes away.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
Since deferred constants can now be of a nonprivate type,
we have made this a stand-alone @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]},
rather than a subclause of @RefSec{Private Types and Private Extensions}.

they are simply a special case of @nt<object_declaration>s.

@begin{Discussion}
The concept of the @i(value) of a limited type is difficult
to define, since the abstract value of a limited type often
extends beyond its physical representation. In some
sense, values of a limited type cannot be divorced from
their object. The value @i(is) the object.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00318-02]}
In Ada 83, in the two places where limited types were defined
by the language, namely tasks and files, an implicit
level of indirection was implied by the semantics to
avoid the separation of the value from an associated
object.
In Ada 95, most limited types are passed by reference,
and even return-ed by reference.@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ In Ada 2005,
most limited types are built-in-place upon return, rather than returned

@begin{Notes}
@i{Notes on the example:}
In the example above, an outside subprogram making use of IO_Package
may obtain a file name by calling Open and later use it in calls to
Read and Write. Thus, outside the package, a file name obtained from
Open acts as a kind of password; its internal properties (such as
containing a numeric value) are not known and no other operations
(such as addition or comparison of internal names) can be performed
on a file name.
Most importantly, clients of the package cannot make copies
of objects of type File_Name.

@NoPrefix@;This example is characteristic of any case where complete control
over the operations of a type is desired. Such packages serve a dual
purpose. They prevent a user from making use of the internal
structure of the type. They also implement the notion of an
encapsulated data type where the only operations on the type are
those given in the package specification.

@NoPrefix@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00318-02]}

@begin{Intro}
@redundant[@Defn{user-defined assignment}
@Defn2{Term=[assignment], Sec=(user-defined)}
Three kinds of actions are
fundamental to the manipulation of objects:
initialization, finalization, and assignment.
Every object is initialized, either explicitly
or by default, after being created
(for example, by an @nt{object_declaration} or @nt{allocator}).
Every object is finalized before being destroyed
(for example, by leaving a @nt{subprogram_body} containing an
@nt{object_declaration}, or by a call to an instance of
Unchecked_Deallocation).
An assignment operation is used as part of @nt{assignment_statement}s,
explicit initialization, parameter passing, and other operations.
@IndexSee{Term=[constructor],See=[initialization]}
@IndexSee{Term=[constructor],See=[Initialize]}
@IndexSee{Term=[destructor],See=[finalization]}

Default definitions for these three fundamental
operations are provided by the
language, but
@Defn{controlled type}
a @i{controlled} type gives the user additional
control over parts of these operations.
@Defn{Initialize}@Defn{Finalize}@Defn{Adjust}
In particular, the user can define, for a controlled type,
an Initialize procedure which is invoked immediately after
the normal default initialization of a controlled object, a Finalize procedure
which is invoked immediately before finalization of any of the
components of a controlled object, and an Adjust
procedure which is invoked as the last step of an assignment to
a (nonlimited) controlled object.]
@ToGlossary{Term=<Controlled type>,
  Text=<A controlled type supports user-defined assignment and
  finalization.
  Objects are always finalized before being destroyed.>}
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01],ARef=[AI95-00287-01]}
Here's the basic idea of initialization, value adjustment, and finalization,
whether or not user defined:
When an object is created,
if it is explicitly assigned an initial value,
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[the object is either built-in-place from an @nt{aggregate}
or function call (in which case neither Adjust nor Initialize is applied), or ],Old=[]}
the assignment copies and
adjusts the initial value. Otherwise, Initialize is applied to it
(except in the case of an @nt{aggregate} as a whole).
An @nt{assignment_statement} finalizes the target before
copying in and adjusting the new value.
Whenever an object goes away, it is finalized.
Calls on Initialize and Adjust happen bottom-up; that is,
components first, followed by the containing object.
Calls on Finalize @Chg{Version=[2],New=[happen],Old=[happens]} top-down; that is,
first the containing object, and then its components.
These ordering rules ensure that any components will be in a
well-defined state when Initialize, Adjust,
or Finalize is applied to the containing object.

@Redundant[since this operator is incorporated into

@RefSecNum(Relational Operators and Membership Tests).]
The type Limited_Controlled is like Controlled, except
that it is limited and it lacks the primitive subprogram Adjust.
@begin{Discussion}
We say @lquotes@;nonlimited controlled type@rquotes@ (rather than just
@lquotes@;controlled type@rquotes@;;) when we want to talk about descendants
of Controlled only.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Reason}
  We considered making Adjust and Finalize abstract.
  However, a reasonable coding convention is e.g. for Finalize to
  always call the parent's Finalize after doing whatever work is needed
  for the extension part.
  (Unlike CLOS, we have no way to do that automatically in Ada 95.)
  For this to work, Finalize cannot be abstract.
  In a generic unit, for a generic formal abstract derived type whose
  ancestor is Controlled or Limited_Controlled, calling the ancestor's
  Finalize would be illegal if it were abstract, even though the actual
  type might have a concrete version.

  Types Controlled and Limited_Controlled are abstract, even though

The assignment to A.Y is not considered an assignment to A.

@end{Discussion}

Initialize and other initialization
operations are done in an arbitrary order,
except as follows.@PDefn2{Term=[arbitrary order],Sec=[allowed]}
Initialize is applied to an object after initialization
of its subcomponents, if any
@Redundant[(including both implicit initialization and Initialize calls)].
If an object has a component with an access discriminant
constrained by a per-object expression,
Initialize is applied to this component after any components that do not
have such discriminants.
For an object with several components with such a discriminant,
Initialize is applied to them in order
of their @nt{component_declaration}s.
For an @nt<allocator>,
any task activations follow all calls
on Initialize.
@begin{Reason}
  The fact that Initialize is done for subcomponents
  first allows Initialize for a composite
  object to refer to its subcomponents knowing
  they have been properly initialized.

  The fact that Initialize is done for components with access
  discriminants after other components
  allows the Initialize operation for a component
  with a self-referential access discriminant to assume
  that other components of the enclosing object have already been
  properly initialized.
  For multiple such components, it allows some predictability.
@end{Reason}

@leading@keepnext@Defn{assignment operation}
When a target object with any controlled parts is assigned a value,

@Defn{adjusting the value of an object}
@Defn{adjustment}
To adjust the value of a
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[],Old=[@Redundant[(nonlimited)] ]}composite object,
the values of the components of the object are first
adjusted in an arbitrary order,
and then, if the object is
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[nonlimited ],Old=[]}controlled,
Adjust is called.@PDefn2{Term=[arbitrary order],Sec=[allowed]}
Adjusting the value of an elementary object has no effect@Redundant[,

@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0067-1]}
  Adjustment is never @Chg{Version=[3],New=[actually ],Old=[]}performed for

@begin{Reason}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0005-1]}
  The verbiage in the Initialize rule about access discriminants

  do not have defaults, so the discriminant can only be changed by
  an assignment to an outer object. Such an assignment could
  happen only before any adjustments or (if part of an outer Adjust)
  only after any inner (component) adjustments have completed.],
  Old=[, and therefore are never adjusted.]}
@end{Reason}

@PDefn2{Term=[execution], Sec=(assignment_statement)}
For an @nt{assignment_statement},
@Redundant[ after the @nt{name} and
@nt{expression} have been evaluated,
and any conversion (including constraint checking) has been done,]
an anonymous object is created, and
the value is assigned into it;
@Redundant[that is, the assignment operation is applied].
@Redundant[(Assignment includes value adjustment.)]
The target of the @nt{assignment_statement} is then finalized.
The value of the anonymous object is then assigned into the target of
the @nt{assignment_statement}.
Finally, the anonymous object is finalized.
@Redundant[As explained below,
the implementation may eliminate the intermediate anonymous object,
so this description subsumes the one given in
@RefSec{Assignment Statements}.]
@begin{Reason}
@leading@;An alternative design for user-defined assignment might involve an
Assign operation instead of Adjust:
@begin{Example}
@key[procedure] Assign(Target : @key[in] @key[out] Controlled; Source : @key[in] @key[out] Controlled);
@end{Example}

@leading@keepnext@;Or perhaps even a syntax like this:
@begin{Example}
@key[procedure] ":="(Target : @key[in] @key[out] Controlled; Source : @key[in] @key[out] Controlled);
@end{Example}

@leading@;Assign (or ":=") would have the responsibility of doing the copy,
as well as whatever else is necessary.
This would have the advantage that the Assign operation knows about both
the target and the source at the same time @em it would be possible to
do things like reuse storage belonging to the target, for example,
which Adjust cannot do.
However, this sort of design would not work in the case of unconstrained
discriminated variables, because there is no way to change the
discriminants individually.
For example:
@begin{Example}
@key[type] Mutable(D : Integer := 0) @key[is]
    @key[record]
        X : Array_Of_Controlled_Things(1..D);
        @key[case] D @key[is]
            @key[when] 17 => Y : Controlled_Thing;
            @key[when] @key[others] => @key[null];
        @key[end] D;
    @key[end] @key[record];
@end{Example}

An assignment to an unconstrained variable of type Mutable can cause
some of the components of X, and the component Y, to appear and/or
disappear.
There is no way to write the Assign operation to handle this sort of
case.

Forbidding such cases is not an option @em it would cause generic
contract model violations.

a noncontrolled type,
the implementation may finalize and assign each

@begin{Reason}
For example, in a slice assignment, an anonymous object is not necessary
if the slice is copied component-by-component in the right direction,

@Defn2{Term=[finalization], Sec=(of a master)}
For the @i{finalization} of a master,
dependent tasks are first awaited,
as explained in @RefSecNum{Task Dependence - Termination of Tasks}.
Then each object whose accessibility level is
the same as that of the master is finalized
if the object was successfully initialized and still exists.
@Redundant[These actions are performed whether the master is left
  by reaching the last statement or via a transfer of control.]
When a transfer of control causes completion of an execution, each
included master is finalized in order, from innermost outward.
@begin{Ramification}
  As explained in @RefSecNum{Operations of Access Types},
  the set of objects with the same accessibility level
  as that of the master
  includes objects declared immediately within the master,
  objects declared in nested packages,
  objects created by @nt{allocator}s
  (if the ultimate ancestor access type is declared in one of those places)
  and subcomponents of all of these things.
  If an object was already finalized by Unchecked_Deallocation,
  then it is not finalized again when the master is left.

  Note that any object whose accessibility level is deeper than that of
  the master would no longer exist;
  those objects would have been finalized by some inner master.
  Thus, after leaving a master, the only objects yet to be
  finalized are those whose accessibility level is less deep than that
  of the master.

@begin{Honest}
Subcomponents of objects due to be finalized are not finalized
by the finalization of the master;
they are finalized by the finalization of the containing object.

We need to finalize subcomponents of objects even if the containing
object is not going to get finalized because it was not fully
initialized.
But if the containing object is finalized, we don't want to require
repeated finalization of the subcomponents,
as might normally be implied by the recursion in finalization of a
master and the recursion in finalization of an object.

@begin{Honest}
Formally, completion and leaving refer to executions of constructs or
entities.
However, the standard sometimes (informally) refers
to the constructs or entities whose executions are being completed.

An implementation has to ensure that the storage for an object is not
reclaimed when references to the object are still possible
(unless, of course, the user explicitly requests reclamation via an
instance of Unchecked_Deallocation).
This implies, in general, that objects cannot be deallocated one by one
as they are finalized;
a subsequent finalization might reference an object that has been
finalized, and that object had better be in its (well-defined)
finalized state.

Program_Error is raised no earlier than after the finalization of the

and no later than the point where normal execution would have continued.
Any other finalizations due to be performed up to that point are
performed before raising Program_Error.
@begin{Ramification}
For example, upon leaving a @nt{block_statement} due to a
@nt{goto_statement}, the Program_Error would be raised at the point of the
target statement denoted by the label,
or else in some more dynamically nested place,
but not so nested as to allow an @nt{exception_handler} that has
visibility upon the finalized object to handle it.
For example,
@begin{Example}
@key[procedure] Main @key[is]
@key[begin]
    <<The_Label>>
    Outer_Block_Statement : @key[declare]
        X : Some_Controlled_Type;
    @key[begin]
        Inner_Block_Statement : @key[declare]
            Y : Some_Controlled_Type;
            Z : Some_Controlled_Type;
        @key[begin]
            @key[goto] The_Label;
        @key[exception]
            @key[when] Program_Error => ... --@RI{ Handler number 1.}
        @key[end];
    @key[exception]
        @key[when] Program_Error => ... --@RI{ Handler number 2.}
    @key[end];
@key[exception]
    @key[when] Program_Error => ... --@RI{ Handler number 3.}
@key[end] Main;
@end{Example}

The @nt{goto_statement} will first cause
Finalize(Y) to be called.
Suppose that Finalize(Y) propagates an exception.
Program_Error will be raised after leaving Inner_Block_Statement,
but before leaving Main.
Thus, handler number 1 cannot handle this Program_Error;
it will be handled either by handler number 2 or handler number 3.
If it is handled by handler number 2,
then Finalize(Z) will be done before executing the handler.
If it is handled by handler number 3,
then Finalize(Z) and Finalize(X) will both
be done before executing the handler.
@end{Ramification}

For a Finalize invoked by a transfer of control
that is due to raising an exception,
any other finalizations due to be performed for the same master are
performed; Program_Error is raised immediately after leaving the master.
@begin{Ramification}
If, in the above example, the @nt{goto_statement} were replaced by a
@nt{raise_statement}, then the Program_Error would be handled by
handler number 2, and
Finalize(Z) would be done before executing the handler.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
We considered treating this case in the same way as the others,
but that would render certain @nt{exception_handler}s useless.
For example, suppose the only @nt{exception_handler} is
one for @key{others} in the main subprogram.
If some deeply nested call raises an exception,
causing some Finalize operation to be called,
which then raises an exception,
then normal execution @lquotes@;would have continued@rquotes@;
at the beginning of the @nt{exception_handler}.
Raising Program_Error at that point would cause that
handler's code to be skipped.
One would need two nested @nt{exception_handler}s
to be sure of catching such cases!

On the other hand, the @nt{exception_handler} for a given master
should not be allowed to handle exceptions raised during finalization
of that master.
@end{Reason}

For a Finalize invoked by a transfer of control due to
an abort or selection of a terminate alternative,
the exception is ignored;
any other finalizations due to be performed are performed.
@begin{Ramification}
This case includes an asynchronous transfer of control.

@begin{Notes}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
The rules of @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]} 10 imply that
immediately prior to partition termination, Finalize operations
are applied to library-level controlled objects (including those
created by @nt{allocator}s of library-level access types, except those
already finalized).
This occurs after waiting for library-level
tasks to terminate.
@begin{Discussion}
We considered defining a pragma that would apply to a controlled
type that would suppress Finalize operations for library-level objects
of the type upon partition termination.
This would be useful for types whose finalization actions
consist of simply reclaiming global heap storage, when this is already
provided automatically by the environment upon program termination.
@end{Discussion}

A constant is only constant between its initialization and
finalization.
Both initialization and finalization are allowed to
change the value of a constant.

Abort is deferred during certain operations related to controlled types,
as explained in
@RefSecNum{Abort of a Task - Abort of a Sequence of Statements}.
Those rules prevent an abort from causing a controlled object
to be left in an ill-defined state.

The Finalize procedure is called upon finalization of
a controlled object, even if Finalize was called earlier,
either explicitly or as part of an assignment; hence,
if a controlled type is visibly controlled (implying that its Finalize
primitive is directly callable), or is nonlimited (implying that
assignment is allowed), its Finalize procedure should be
designed to have no ill effect if it is applied a second time
to the same object.
@begin{Discussion}
  Or equivalently, a Finalize procedure
  should be @lquotes@;idempotent@rquotes@;;
  applying it twice to the same object should be equivalent to
  applying it once.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Reason}
  A user-written Finalize procedure should be idempotent since it
  can be called explicitly
  by a client (at least if the type is "visibly" controlled).
  Also, Finalize is used implicitly as part of the
  @nt<assignment_statement> if the
  type is nonlimited, and an abort is permitted to disrupt an
  @nt<assignment_statement> between finalizing the left-hand side
  and assigning the new value to it (an abort is not permitted to
  disrupt an assignment operation between copying in the new value
  and adjusting it).
@end{Reason}
@begin{Discussion}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00287-01]}
Either Initialize or Adjust,
but not both, is applied to (almost) every controlled object
when it is created:
Initialize is done when no initial value is assigned to the object,
whereas Adjust is done as part of assigning the initial value.
The one exception is the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[anonymous ]}object
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[initialized],Old=[created]} by an
@nt{aggregate}@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ (both the anonymous object created for

as a whole, nor is the value of the @nt<aggregate> @Chg{Version=[2],
New=[or object ],Old=[]}adjusted.

@leading@Defn2{Term=[assignment operation], Sec=(list of uses)}
All of the following use the assignment operation,
and thus perform value adjustment:
@begin{Itemize}
the @nt{assignment_statement} (see @RefSecNum{Assignment Statements});

explicit initialization of a stand-alone object
(see @RefSecNum{Object Declarations})
or of a pool element (see @RefSecNum{Allocators});

default initialization of a component of a stand-alone object
or pool element

@begin{Itemize}
By-copy parameter passing uses the assignment operation
(see @RefSecNum{Parameter Associations}),
but controlled objects are always passed by reference,
so the assignment operation never does anything interesting in
this case.
If we were to allow by-copy parameter passing for controlled objects,
we would need to make sure that the actual is finalized before doing
the copy back for [@key{in}] @key{out} parameters.
The finalization of the parameter itself needs to happen
after the copy back (if any),
similar to the finalization of an anonymous function return
object or @nt{aggregate} object.

@key{For} loops use the assignment operation
(see @RefSecNum{Loop Statements}), but since the type
of the loop parameter is never controlled,
nothing interesting happens there, either.

Finalization of the parts of a protected object are not done as
protected actions.
It is possible (in pathological cases)
to create tasks during finalization that
access these parts in parallel with the finalization itself.
This is an erroneous use of shared variables.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{ImplNote}
One implementation technique for finalization is to chain the
controlled objects together on a per-task list.
When leaving a master, the list can be walked up to a marked place.
The links needed to implement the list can be declared (privately)
in types Controlled and Limited_Controlled,
so they will be inherited by all controlled types.

Another implementation technique, which we refer to as the @lquotes@;PC-map@rquotes@;
approach essentially implies inserting exception handlers at various
places, and finalizing objects based on where the exception was
raised.

@Defn{PC-map approach to finalization}
@Defn{program-counter-map approach to finalization}
The PC-map approach is for the compiler/linker to create a map of
code addresses; when an exception is raised, or abort occurs,
the map can be consulted to see where the task was executing,
and what finalization needs to be performed.
This approach was given in the Ada 83 Rationale as a
possible implementation strategy for exception handling @em the
map is consulted to determine which exception handler applies.

If the PC-map approach is used, the implementation must take care in the
case of arrays. The generated code will generally contain a loop to
initialize an array. If an exception is raised part way through the
array, the components that have been initialized must be finalized,
and the others must not be finalized.

It is our intention that both of these implementation methods should
be possible.

@begin{DiffWord83}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
Finalization depends on the concepts of completion and leaving,
and on the concept of a master.
Therefore, we have moved the definitions of these concepts here,
from where they used to be in
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]} @RefSecNum{Tasks and Synchronization}.
These concepts also needed to be generalized somewhat.
Task waiting is closely related to user-defined finalization;
the rules here refer to the task-waiting rules of
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]} @RefSecNum{Tasks and Synchronization}.
