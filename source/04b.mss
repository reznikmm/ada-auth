@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@Redundant[Explicit type conversions, both
value conversions and view conversions, are
allowed between closely related
types as defined below. This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}
also defines rules for value and view
conversions to a particular subtype of a type,
both explicit ones and those implicit in other constructs.

  | @Syn2{subtype_mark}(@Syn2{name})"}

@end{Syntax}

@begin{Intro}
@Defn2{Term=[target subtype], Sec=(of a @nt<type_conversion>)}
The @i(target subtype) of a @nt<type_conversion> is the subtype
denoted by the @nt{subtype_mark}.
@Defn2{Term=[operand], Sec=(of a @nt<type_conversion>)}
The @i(operand) of a @nt<type_conversion> is the
@nt{expression} or @nt{name} within the parentheses;
@Defn2{Term=[operand type], Sec=(of a @nt<type_conversion>)}
its type is the @i(operand type).

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@Defn{convertible}
One type is @i(convertible) to a second type if a @nt<type_conversion>
with the first type as operand type and the second type as target type
is legal according to the rules of this @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}.
Two types are convertible if each is convertible to the other.
@begin{Ramification}
  Note that @lquotes@;convertible@rquotes@; is defined in terms of legality
  of the conversion. Whether the conversion would raise an exception
  at run time is irrelevant to this definition.

@Defn{view conversion}
@Defn2{Term=[conversion],Sec=(view)}
A @nt{type_conversion} whose operand is the
@nt<name> of an object is called a @i(view conversion) if
@Chg{New=[both ],Old=[]}its target type
@Chg{New=[and operand type are],Old=[is]} tagged, or if it
appears@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ in a call],Old=[]} as an actual parameter of mode
@key[out] or @key[in out];
@Defn{value conversion}
@Defn2{Term=[conversion],Sec=(value)}
other @nt<type_conversion>s are called @i(value conversions).
@IndexSee{Term=[super],See=(view conversion)}
@begin{Ramification}
  A view conversion to a tagged type can appear in
  any context that requires an object @nt<name>, including in
  an object renaming, the @nt<prefix> of a @nt<selected_component>,
  and if the operand is a variable, on the left side of an
  @nt<assignment_statement>. View conversions to other types only
  occur as actual parameters. Allowing view conversions of untagged
  types in all contexts seemed to incur an undue implementation burden.

  @ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[A type conversion appearing as an @key{in out}
  parameter in a generic instantiation is not a view conversion; the second
  part of the rule only applies to subprogram calls, not instantiations.]}
@end{Ramification}
@end{Intro}

@begin{Resolution}
@PDefn2{Term=[expected type],
  Sec=(type_conversion operand)}
The operand of a @nt<type_conversion> is expected to be of any type.
@begin{Discussion}
  This replaces the "must be determinable" wording of Ada 83.
  This is equivalent to (but hopefully more intuitive than) saying
  that the operand of a @nt<type_conversion>
  is a @lquotes@;complete context.@rquotes@;
@end{Discussion}

The operand of a view conversion
is interpreted only as a @nt<name>;
the operand of a value conversion
is interpreted as an @nt<expression>.
@begin{Reason}
  @ChgRef{Version=[4],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0005-1]}
  This formally resolves the syntactic ambiguity between
  the two forms of @nt<type_conversion>@Chg{Version=[4],New=[.
  This matters as an @nt{expression} that is a @nt{name} is evaluated and
  represents a value while a @nt{name} by itself can be an object; we want
  a view conversion to be an object],Old=[, not that it really matters]}.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
  @ChgRef{Version=[4],Kind=[AddedNormal],ARef=[AI12-0005-1]}
  @ChgAdded{Version=[4],Text=[This wording uses "interpreted as" rather than
  "shall be" so that this rule is not used to resolve overloading; it is
  solely about evaluation as described above.]}

@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[The entire @LegalityTitle section has been
reorganized to eliminate an
unintentional incompatibility with Ada 83. In rare cases, a type conversion
between two types related by derivation is not allowed by Ada 95, while it is
allowed in Ada 83. The reorganization fixes this.
Much of the wording of the legality section is unchanged, but it is reordered
and reformatted. Because of the limitations of our tools, we had to delete and
replace nearly the entire section. The text of Ada 95 paragraphs 8 through 12,
14, 15, 17, 19, 20, and 24 are unchanged (just moved); these are now

@begin{Reason}
This definition is needed because the semantics of various
constructs involves converting to a type,
whereas an explicit @nt{type_conversion} actually converts to a subtype.
For example, the evaluation of a @nt{range} is defined to convert the
values of the expressions to the type of the range.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
A conversion to a scalar type, or, equivalently,
to an unconstrained scalar subtype,
can raise Constraint_Error if the value is outside the base range of the
type.

@end{Discussion}
@end{RunTime}

@begin{Notes}
@RootDefn{implicit subtype conversion}
In addition to explicit @nt<type_conversion>s,
type conversions are performed implicitly in situations where the
expected type and the actual type of a construct differ,
as is permitted by the type resolution rules
(see @RefSecNum(The Context of Overload Resolution)).
For example, an integer literal is
of the type @i(universal_integer), and is implicitly converted
when assigned to a target of some specific integer type.
Similarly, an actual parameter of a specific
tagged type is implicitly converted when the corresponding
formal parameter is of a class-wide type.

@NoPrefix@;@RootDefn{implicit subtype conversion}
@Defn2{Term=[Constraint_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
Even when the expected and actual types are the same,
implicit subtype conversions are performed to adjust the array bounds (if any)
of an operand to match the desired target subtype, or to
raise Constraint_Error if the (possibly adjusted) value does not satisfy
the constraints of the target subtype.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00230-01]}
A ramification of the
overload resolution rules is that the operand of
an (explicit) @nt<type_conversion> cannot be
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[the literal @key(null), ]}an @nt<allocator>,
an @nt<aggregate>, a @nt<string_literal>,
a @nt<character_literal>, or an @nt<attribute_reference>
for an Access or Unchecked_Access attribute.
Similarly, such an @nt{expression} enclosed by parentheses is not
allowed. A @nt<qualified_expression> (see @RefSecNum(Qualified Expressions))
can be used instead of such a @nt<type_conversion>.

The constraint of the target subtype has no effect
for a @nt<type_conversion> of an elementary type passed
as an @key(out) parameter. Hence, it is recommended
that the first subtype be specified
as the target to minimize confusion
(a similar recommendation applies to renaming and
generic formal @key(in out) objects).

@begin{Incompatible83}
@Defn{incompatibilities with Ada 83}
A @nt<character_literal> is not allowed as the
operand of a @nt<type_conversion>,
since there are now two character types in package Standard.

The component subtypes have to statically match in an array conversion,
rather than being checked for matching constraints at run time.

Because sliding of array bounds is now provided for operations where it
was not in Ada 83,
programs that used to raise Constraint_Error might now
continue executing and produce a reasonable result.
This is likely to fix more bugs than it creates.
@end{Incompatible83}

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
A @nt<type_conversion> is considered the name of an object
in certain circumstances (such a @nt<type_conversion>
is called a view conversion).
In particular, as in Ada 83,
a @nt<type_conversion> can appear as an @key(in out) or @key(out)
actual parameter. In addition, if the target type is tagged
and the operand is the @nt<name> of an object, then so
is the @nt<type_conversion>, and it can be used as the @nt<prefix>
to a @nt<selected_component>, in an @nt<object_renaming_declaration>, etc.

We no longer require type-mark conformance between
a parameter of the form of a type conversion, and the corresponding
formal parameter. This had caused some problems for
inherited subprograms (since there isn't really a type-mark
for converted formals), as well as for renamings, formal subprograms,
etc. See AI83-00245, AI83-00318, AI83-00547.

We now specify @lquotes@;deterministic@rquotes@; rounding from real to integer types
when the value of the operand is exactly between two integers
(rounding is away from zero in this case).

@lquotes@;Sliding@rquotes@; of array bounds
(which is part of conversion to an array subtype)
is performed in more cases in Ada 95 than in Ada 83.
Sliding is not performed on
the operand of a membership test,
nor on the operand of a @nt{qualified_expression}.
It wouldn't make sense on a membership test,
and we wish to retain a connection between subtype membership
and subtype qualification. In general, a subtype membership test returns
True if and only if a corresponding subtype qualification
succeeds without raising an exception.
Other operations that take arrays perform sliding.

@LabeledClause{Static Expressions and Static Subtypes}

@begin{Intro}
Certain expressions of a scalar or string type are defined to be static.
Similarly, certain discrete ranges are defined to be static, and
certain scalar and string subtypes are defined to be static subtypes.
@Redundant[@Defn{static}
@i(Static) means determinable at compile time,

@begin{Discussion}

@end{Discussion}
@end{Intro}

@begin{MetaRules}
For an expression to be static,
it has to be calculable at compile time.

Only scalar and string expressions are static.

To be static, an expression cannot have any nonscalar, nonstring
subexpressions (though it can have nonscalar constituent @nt<name>s).
A static scalar expression cannot have any nonscalar subexpressions.
There is one exception @em a membership test for a string subtype
can be static, and the result is scalar, even though a subexpression
is nonscalar.

The rules for evaluating static expressions are designed
to maximize portability of static calculations.

@ChgAdded{Version=[5],Text=[We support static string expressions so that, for

@Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(subtype)}
A @i(static subtype) is either a @i(static scalar subtype) or a
@i(static string subtype).
@Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(scalar subtype)}
A static scalar subtype is an unconstrained scalar subtype whose
type is not a descendant of a
formal @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[scalar ]}type, or
a constrained scalar subtype formed by imposing a compatible
static constraint on a static scalar subtype.
@Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(string subtype)}

New=[ Also, a subtype is not static if any Dynamic_Predicate specifications

@begin{Ramification}
  String subtypes are the only composite subtypes that can be static.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
@Leading@;The part about generic formal objects of mode @key[in out]
is necessary because the subtype of the formal is not required
to have anything to do with the subtype of the actual.
For example:
@begin{Example}
@key[subtype] Int10 @key[is] Integer @key[range] 1..10;

@key[generic]
    F : @key[in] @key[out] Int10;
@key[procedure] G;

@key[procedure] G @key[is]
@key[begin]
    @key[case] F @key[is]
        @key[when] 1..10 => @key[null];
        --@RI{ Illegal!}
    @key[end] @key[case];
@key[end] G;

X : Integer @key[range] 1..20;
@key[procedure] I @key[is] @key[new] G(F => X); --@RI{ OK.}
@end{Example}

The @nt{case_statement} is illegal, because the subtype of F is not
static, so the choices have to cover all values of Integer,
not just those in the range 1..10.
A similar issue arises for generic formal functions,
now that function calls are object names.
@end{Reason}

@Leading@Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(constraint)}
The different kinds of @i(static constraint) are defined as follows:
@begin(itemize)
  A null constraint is always static;

  @Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(range constraint)}
  @Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(digits constraint)}
  @Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(delta constraint)}
  A scalar constraint is static if it has no
  @nt<range_constraint>,
  or one with a static range;

  @Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(index constraint)}
  An index constraint is static if each
  @nt<discrete_range> is static, and each index subtype of the
  corresponding array type is static;

  @Defn2{Term=[static], Sec=(discriminant constraint)}
  A discriminant constraint is static if
  each @nt<expression> of the constraint is static,
  and the subtype of each discriminant is static.

@begin{Notes}
An expression can be static even if it occurs in a context where
staticness is not required.
@begin{Ramification}

@Leading@keepnext@;For example:
@begin{Example}
X : Float := Float'(1.0E+400) + 1.0 - Float'(1.0E+400);
@end{Example}

The expression is static,
which means that the value of X must be exactly 1.0,
independent of the accuracy or range of the run-time floating point
implementation.

The following kinds of expressions are never static:
@nt{explicit_dereference},
@nt{indexed_component},
@nt{slice},
@key{null},
@nt{aggregate},
@nt{allocator}.
@end{Ramification}

A static (or run-time) @nt<type_conversion> from a real type to
an integer type performs rounding. If the operand value is exactly half-way
between two integers, the rounding is performed away from zero.
@begin{Reason}
  We specify this for portability. The reason for not choosing
  round-to-nearest-even, for example, is that this method is easier
  to undo.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
  The attribute Truncation
  (see @RefSecNum{Attributes of Floating Point Types})
  can be used to perform a (static) truncation prior to conversion,
  to prevent rounding.

@begin{ImplNote}

  The value of the literal
  0E999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999

@end{Examples}

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The rules for static expressions and static subtypes are generalized
to allow more kinds of compile-time-known expressions to be used
where compile-time-known values are required, as follows:
@begin(itemize)
Membership tests and short-circuit control forms
may appear in a static expression.

The bounds and length of
statically constrained array objects or subtypes are static.

The Range attribute of a statically constrained array subtype or
object gives a static range.

A @nt{type_conversion} is static if the @nt{subtype_mark} denotes a
static scalar subtype and the operand is a static expression.

All numeric literals are now static, even if the expected
type is a formal scalar type.
This is useful in @nt{case_statement}s and @nt{variant_part}s,
which both now allow a value of a formal scalar type to
control the selection, to
ease conversion of a package into a generic package.
Similarly, named array aggregates are also permitted for array
types with an index type that is a formal scalar type.
@end(itemize)

The rules for the evaluation of static expressions
are revised to require exact evaluation at compile time,
and force a machine number result when crossing from the static realm
to the dynamic realm,
to enhance portability and predictability.
Exact evaluation is not required for
descendants of a formal scalar type,
to simplify generic code sharing and to avoid generic
contract model problems.

@Leading@;Static expressions are legal even if an intermediate
in the expression goes outside the base range of the type. Therefore, the
following will succeed in Ada 95, whereas it might raise an
exception in Ada 83:
@begin{Example}
@key[type] Short_Int @key[is] @key[range] -32_768 .. 32_767;
I : Short_Int := -32_768;
@end{Example}

This might raise an exception in Ada 83 because "32_768" is out of range,
even though "@en@;32_768" is not. In Ada 95, this will always succeed.


Certain expressions involving string operations
(in particular concatenation and membership tests)
are considered static in Ada 95.


The reason for this change is to simplify the rule requiring
compile-time-known string expressions as the link name in an interfacing
pragma, and to simplify the preelaborability rules.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{Incompatible83}
@Defn{incompatibilities with Ada 83}
An Ada 83 program that uses an out-of-range static value
is illegal in Ada 95, unless the expression is part of a larger
static expression, or the expression is not evaluated due to being on
the right-hand side of a short-circuit control form.
@end{Incompatible83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}
(and @RefSec{Multiplying Operators})
subsumes the RM83 section on Universal Expressions.

The existence of static string expressions
necessitated changing the definition of static subtype to
include string subtypes.
Most occurrences of "static subtype" have been changed to "static scalar
subtype",
in order to preserve the effect of the Ada 83 rules.
This has the added benefit of clarifying the difference between "static
subtype" and "statically constrained subtype", which has been a source
of confusion.
In cases where we allow static string subtypes,
we explicitly use phrases like "static string subtype"
or "static (scalar or string) subtype",
in order to clarify the meaning for those who have gotten used to the
Ada 83 terminology.


@Leading@;In Ada 83, an expression was considered nonstatic if it raised an
exception.
Thus, for example:
@begin{Example}
Bad: @key[constant] := 1/0; --@RI{ Illegal!}
@end{Example}

was illegal because 1/0 was not static.
In Ada 95, the above example is still illegal,
but for a different reason:
1/0 is static, but there's a separate rule forbidding the exception
raising.
