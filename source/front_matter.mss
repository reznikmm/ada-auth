@SubHeading(Design Goals)

@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised]}
Ada was originally designed with three overriding concerns:
program reliability and maintenance, programming as a human
activity, and efficiency. @Chg{Version=[2],New=[The 1995],Old=[This]} revision
to the language was designed to provide greater flexibility and extensibility,
additional control over storage management and
synchronization, and standardized packages oriented toward
supporting important application areas, while at the same
time retaining the original emphasis on reliability,
maintainability, and efficiency.@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ This
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[third edition],Old=[amended version]}
provides further flexibility and adds more standardized packages within the
framework provided by the 1995 revision.],Old=[]}

The need for languages that promote reliability and simplify
maintenance is well established. Hence emphasis was placed
on program readability over ease of writing. For example,
the rules of the language require that program variables be
explicitly declared and that their type be specified. Since
the type of a variable is invariant, compilers can ensure
that operations on variables are compatible with the
properties intended for objects of the type. Furthermore,
error-prone notations have been avoided, and the syntax of
the language avoids the use of encoded forms in favor of
more English-like constructs. Finally, the language offers
support for separate compilation of program units in a way
that facilitates program development and maintenance, and
which provides the same degree of checking between units as
within a unit.

Concern for the human programmer was also stressed during
the design. Above all, an attempt was made to keep to a
relatively small number of underlying concepts integrated in
a consistent and systematic way while continuing to avoid
the pitfalls of excessive involution. The design especially
aims to provide language constructs that correspond
intuitively to the normal expectations of users.

Like many other human activities, the development of
programs is becoming ever more decentralized and
distributed. Consequently, the ability to assemble a
program from independently produced software components
continues to be a central idea in the design. The concepts
of packages, of private types, and of generic units are
directly related to this idea, which has ramifications in
many other aspects of the language. An allied concern is
the maintenance of programs to match changing requirements;
type extension and the hierarchical library enable a program
to be modified while minimizing disturbance to existing
tested and trusted components.

No language can avoid the problem of efficiency. Languages
that require over-elaborate compilers, or that lead to the
inefficient use of storage or execution time, force these
inefficiencies on all machines and on all programs. Every
construct of the language was examined in the light of
present implementation techniques. Any proposed construct
whose implementation was unclear or that required excessive
machine resources was rejected.
@end{Intro}

@SubHeading{Language Summary}

@begin{Intro}
An Ada program is composed of one or more program units.
Program units may be subprograms (which define executable
algorithms), packages (which define collections of
entities), task units (which define concurrent
computations), protected units (which define operations for
the coordinated sharing of data between tasks), or generic
units (which define parameterized forms of packages and
subprograms). Each program unit normally consists of two parts: a
specification, containing the information that must be
visible to other units, and a body, containing the
implementation details, which need not be visible to other
units. Most program units can be compiled separately.

This distinction of the specification and body, and the
ability to compile units separately, allows a program to be
designed, written, and tested as a set of largely
independent software components.

An Ada program will normally make use of a library of
program units of general utility. The language provides
means whereby individual organizations can construct their
own libraries. All libraries are structured in a
hierarchical manner; this enables the logical decomposition
of a subsystem into individual components. The text of a
separately compiled program unit must name the library units
it requires.


@keepnext@i(Program Units)

A subprogram is the basic unit for expressing an algorithm.
There are two kinds of subprograms: procedures and
functions. A procedure is the means of invoking a series of
actions. For example, it may read data, update variables,
or produce some output. It may have parameters, to provide
a controlled means of passing information between the
procedure and the point of call.
A function is the means of invoking the computation of a
value. It is similar to a procedure, but in addition will
return a result.

A package is the basic unit for defining a collection of
logically related entities. For example, a package can be
used to define a set of type declarations and
associated operations. Portions of a package can be hidden
from the user, thus allowing access only to the logical
properties expressed by the package specification.

Subprogram and package units may be compiled separately and
arranged in hierarchies of parent and child units giving
fine control over visibility of the logical properties and
their detailed implementation.

A task unit is the basic unit for defining a task whose
sequence of actions may be executed concurrently with those
of other tasks. Such tasks may be implemented on
multicomputers, multiprocessors, or with interleaved
execution on a single processor. A task unit may define
either a single executing task or a task type permitting the
creation of any number of similar tasks.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
A protected unit is the basic unit for defining protected
operations for the coordinated use of data shared between
tasks. Simple mutual exclusion is provided automatically,
and more elaborate sharing protocols can be defined. A
protected operation can either be a subprogram or an entry.
A protected entry specifies a Boolean expression (an entry
barrier) that must be @Chg{Version=[2],New=[True],Old=[true]}
before the body of the entry is
executed. A protected unit may define a single protected
object or a protected type permitting the creation of
several similar objects.

@keepnext@i(Declarations and Statements)

The body of a program unit generally contains two parts: a
declarative part, which defines the logical entities to be
used in the program unit, and a sequence of statements,
which defines the execution of the program unit.

The declarative part associates names with declared
entities. For example, a name may denote a type, a
constant, a variable, or an exception. A declarative part
also introduces the names and parameters of other nested
subprograms, packages, task units, protected units, and
generic units to be used in the program unit.

The sequence of statements describes a sequence of actions
that are to be performed. The statements are executed in
succession (unless a transfer of control causes execution to continue
from another place).

An assignment statement changes the value of a variable. A
procedure call invokes execution of a procedure after
associating any actual parameters provided at the call with
the corresponding formal parameters.

Case statements and if statements allow the selection of an
enclosed sequence of statements based on the value of an
expression or on the value of a condition.

The loop statement provides the basic iterative mechanism in
the language. A loop statement specifies that a sequence of
statements is to be executed repeatedly as directed by an
iteration scheme, or until an exit statement is encountered.

A block statement comprises a sequence of statements
preceded by the declaration of local entities used by the
statements.

@ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0119-1]}
Certain statements are associated with concurrent execution.
A delay statement delays the execution of a task for a
specified duration or until a specified time. An entry call
statement is written as a procedure call statement; it
requests an operation on a task or on a protected
object, blocking the caller until the operation can be
performed. A called task may accept an entry call by
executing a corresponding accept statement, which specifies
the actions then to be performed as part of the rendezvous
with the calling task. An entry call on a protected object
is processed when the corresponding entry barrier evaluates
to true, whereupon the body of the entry is executed. The
requeue statement permits the provision of a service as a
number of related activities with preference control. One
form of the select statement allows a selective wait for one
of several alternative rendezvous. Other forms of the
select statement allow conditional or timed entry calls and
the asynchronous transfer of control in response to some
triggering event.@Chg{Version=[5],New=[ Various parallel
constructs, including parallel loops and parallel blocks,
support the initiation of multiple logical threads of control designed
to execute in parallel when multiple processors are available.],Old=[]}

Execution of a program unit may encounter error situations
in which normal program execution cannot continue. For
example, an arithmetic computation may exceed the maximum
allowed value of a number, or an attempt may be made to
access an array component by using an incorrect index value.
To deal with such error situations, the statements of a
program unit can be textually followed by exception handlers
that specify the actions to be taken when the error
situation arises. Exceptions can be raised explicitly by a
raise statement.

@keepnext@i(Data Types)

Every object in the language has a type, which characterizes
a set of values and a set of applicable operations. The
main classes of types are elementary types (comprising
enumeration, numeric, and access types) and composite types
(including array and record types).

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00285-01],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
An enumeration type defines an ordered set of distinct
enumeration literals, for example a list of states or an
alphabet of characters. The enumeration types Boolean,
Character, @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],
Old=[and ]}Wide_Character@Chg{Version=[2],New=[, and Wide_Wide_Character],
Old=[]} are predefined.

Numeric types provide a means of performing exact or
approximate numerical computations. Exact computations use
integer types, which denote sets of consecutive integers.
Approximate computations use either fixed point types, with
absolute bounds on the error, or floating point types, with
relative bounds on the error. The numeric types Integer,
Float, and Duration are predefined.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00285-01],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
Composite types allow definitions of structured objects with
related components. The composite types in the language
include arrays and records. An array is an object with
indexed components of the same type. A record is an object
with named components of possibly different types. Task and
protected types are also forms of composite types. The
array types String@Chg{Version=[2],New=[,],Old=[ and]}
Wide_String@Chg{Version=[2],
New=[, and Wide_Wide_String],Old=[]} are predefined.

Record, task, and protected types may have special components
called discriminants which parameterize the type.
Variant record structures that depend on the values of
discriminants can be defined within a record type.

Access types allow the construction of linked data
structures. A value of an access type represents a
reference to an object declared as aliased or to an object
created by the evaluation of an allocator. Several
variables of an access type may designate the same object,
and components of one object may designate the same or other
objects. Both the elements in such linked data structures
and their relation to other elements can be altered during
program execution. Access types also permit references to
subprograms to be stored, passed as parameters, and
ultimately dereferenced as part of an indirect call.

Private types permit restricted views of a type. A private
type can be defined in a package so that only the logically
necessary properties are made visible to the users of the
type. The full structural details that are externally
irrelevant are then only available within the package and
any child units.

From any type a new type may be defined by derivation. A type,
together with its derivatives (both direct and indirect)
form a derivation class. Class-wide operations may be
defined that accept as a parameter an operand of any type in
a derivation class. For record and private types, the derivatives may
be extensions of the parent type. Types that support these
object-oriented capabilities of class-wide operations and type extension
must be tagged, so that
the specific type of an operand within a derivation class can
be identified at run time. When an operation of a tagged
type is applied to an operand whose specific type is not
known until run time, implicit dispatching is performed
based on the tag of the operand.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[
Interface types provide abstract models from which other interfaces and
types may be composed and derived. This provides a reliable form of multiple
inheritance. Interface types may also be implemented by
task types and protected types thereby enabling concurrent programming and
inheritance to be merged.]}

The concept of a type is further refined by the concept of a
subtype, whereby a user can constrain the set of allowed
values of a type. Subtypes can be used to define subranges
of scalar types, arrays with a limited set of index values,
and records and private types with particular discriminant
values.

@keepnext@i(Other Facilities)

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Aspect],Old=[Representation]} clauses can be
used to specify the mapping
between types and features of an underlying machine. For
example, the user can specify that objects of a given type
must be represented with a given number of bits, or that the
components of a record are to be represented using a given
storage layout. Other features allow the controlled use of
low level, nonportable, or implementation-dependent aspects,
including the direct insertion of machine code.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
The predefined environment of the language provides
for input-output and other capabilities @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[(such
as string manipulation and random number generation) ]}by means of
standard library packages.
Input-output is supported for
values of user-defined as well as of predefined types.
Standard means of representing values in display form are
also provided.@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[ Other standard library packages are defined
in annexes of the standard to support systems with
specialized requirements.]}

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[The predefined standard library packages provide
facilities such as string manipulation, containers of various kinds (vectors,
lists, maps, etc.), mathematical functions, random number generation, and access
to the execution environment.],Old=[]}

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI95-00387-01]}
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[The specialized annexes define further predefined library
packages and facilities with emphasis on areas such as real-time
scheduling, interrupt handling, distributed systems, numerical computation, and
high-integrity systems.],Old=[]}

Finally, the language provides a powerful means of
parameterization of program units, called generic program
units. The generic parameters can be types and subprograms
(as well as objects and packages) and so allow general
algorithms and data structures to be defined that are
applicable to all types of a given class.

design of a test translator with the participation of K. Ripken, P. Boullier, P.
Cadiou, J. Holden, J.F. Hueras, R.G. Lange, and D.T. Cornhill. The entire effort
