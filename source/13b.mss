Name is an enumeration subtype.
Values of type Name are the names of alternative machine
configura@!tions handled by the implementation.
System_Name represents the current machine configuration.

The named numbers Fine_Delta and Tick are of the type
@i{universal_real}; the others are of the type @i{universal_integer}.

@Leading@;The meanings of the named numbers are:
@begin{Description}
@Redundant[
Min_Int @\The smallest (most negative) value
allowed for the expressions of a
@nt{signed_@!integer_@!type_@!definition}.

Max_Int @\The largest (most positive) value
allowed for the expressions of a
@nt{signed_@!integer_@!type_@!definition}.

Max_Binary_Modulus @\A power of two such that it,
and all lesser positive powers of two, are allowed
as the modulus of a @nt<modular_type_definition>.

Max_Nonbinary_Modulus @\A value such that it,
and all lesser positive integers, are allowed
as the modulus of a @nt<modular_type_definition>.
@begin{Ramification}
There is no requirement that Max_Nonbinary_Modulus
be less than or equal to Max_Binary_Modulus,
although that's what makes most sense.
On a typical 32-bit machine, for example,
Max_Binary_Modulus will be 2**32
and Max_Nonbinary_Modulus will be 2**31,
because supporting nonbinary moduli in above 2**31
causes implementation difficulties.
@end{Ramification}

Max_Base_Digits @\The largest value allowed for the requested decimal
precision in a @nt{floating_@!point_@!definition}.

Max_Digits @\The largest value allowed for the requested decimal
precision in a @nt{floating_@!point_@!definition}
that has no @nt{real_@!range_@!specification}.
Max_Digits is less than or equal to Max_Base_Digits.

Max_Mantissa @\The largest possible number of binary digits in the mantissa
of machine numbers of a user-defined ordinary fixed point type.
(The mantissa is defined in @RefSecNum{Numerics}.)

Fine_Delta @\The smallest delta allowed in an @nt{ordinary_fixed_point_definition} that
has the @nt{real_@!range_@!specification} @key{range} @en@;1.0 .. 1.0.
]

Tick @\A period in seconds approximating the real time interval during
which the value of Calendar.Clock remains constant.
@begin{Ramification}
There is no required relationship between System.Tick and
Duration'Small,
other than the one described here.

The inaccuracy of the @nt{delay_statement} has no relation to Tick.
In particular, it is possible that the clock used for the
@nt{delay_statement} is less accurate than Calendar.Clock.

We considered making Tick a run-time-determined quantity,
to allow for easier configurability.
However, this would not be upward compatible,
and the desired configurability can be achieved using
functionality defined in @RefSec{Real-Time Systems}.
@end{Ramification}

Storage_Unit @\The number of bits per storage element.

Word_Size @\The number of bits per word.

Memory_Size @\An implementation-defined value
@Redundant[that is intended to reflect the memory size of the
configuration in storage elements.]
@begin{Discussion}
It is unspecified whether this refers to the size of the
address space, the amount of physical memory on the machine,
or perhaps some other interpretation of @lquotes@;memory size.@rquotes@;
In any case, the value has to be given by a static expression,
even though the amount of memory on many modern machines is
a dynamic quantity in several ways.
Thus, Memory_Size is not very useful.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00161-01]}
Address is @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[of ]}a definite, nonlimited
type@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ with preelaborable initialization (see
@RefSecNum{Elaboration Control})],Old=[]}.
Address represents machine addresses capable of addressing individual
storage elements.
Null_Address is an address that is distinct from the
address of any object or program unit.
@IndexSee{Term=[pointer],See=(type System.Address)}
@begin{Ramification}
The implementation has to ensure that there is at least one
address that nothing will be allocated to;
Null_Address will be one such address.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Ramification}
Address is the type of the result of the attribute Address.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
Address is required to be nonlimited and definite because
it is important to be able to assign addresses,
and to declare uninitialized address variables.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00362-01]}
An implementation may add additional implementation-defined
declarations to package System and its children.
@Redundant[However, it is usually better
for the implementation to provide
additional functionality via implementation-defined
children of System.]@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[
Package System may be declared pure.]}
@begin{Ramification}
The declarations in package System and its children can be implicit.
For example, since Address is not limited,
the predefined "=" and "/=" operations are probably sufficient.
However, the implementation is not @i{required} to use the predefined
"=".
@end{Ramification}
@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{ImplAdvice}
@ChgNote{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{Remove bogus "of"}
Address should be @Chg{New=[],Old=[of ]}a private type.
@begin{Reason}
This promotes uniformity by avoiding having
implementation-defined predefined operations for the type.
We don't require it, because implementations may want to stick with
what they have.
@end{Reason}
@ChgImplAdvice{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],Text=[@ChgAdded{Version=[2],
Text=[Type System.Address should be a private type.]}]}
@begin{ImplNote}
It is not necessary for Address to be able to point at
individual bits within a storage element.
Nor is it necessary for it to be able to point at machine registers.
It is intended as a memory address that matches the hardware's notion
of an address.

The representation of the @key{null} value of a general access type should
be the same as that of Null_Address;
instantiations of Unchecked_Conversion should work accordingly.
If the implementation supports interfaces to other languages,
the representation of the @key{null} value of a general access type
should be the same as in those other languages, if appropriate.

Note that the children of the Interfaces package will generally provide
foreign-language-specific null values where appropriate.
See UI-0065 regarding Null_Address.

@begin{Notes}
There are also some language-defined child packages of System
defined elsewhere.

The presence of ordering operators for type Address is also guaranteed (the
existence of these depends on the definition of Address in an Ada 83
implementation). We do not list these as incompatibilities, as the contents of
System can vary between implementations anyway; thus a program that depends on
the contents of System (by using @f{@key[use] System;} for example) is
already at risk of being incompatible when moved between Ada implementations.]}
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
Much of the content of System is standardized,
to provide more uniformity across implementations.
Implementations can still add their own declarations to System,
but are encouraged to do so via children of System.

Some of the named numbers are defined more explicitly in terms of the
standard numeric types.

The pragmas System_Name, Storage_Unit, and Memory_Size are no
longer defined by the language.
However, the corresponding declarations in package
System still exist.
Existing implementations may continue to support the three
pragmas as implementation-defined pragmas,
if they so desire.

Priority semantics, including subtype Priority,
have been moved to the Real Time Annex.

Storage_Element represents a storage element.
Storage_Offset represents an offset in storage elements.
Storage_Count represents a number of storage elements.
@PDefn{contiguous representation}
@PDefn{discontiguous representation}
Storage_Array represents a contiguous sequence of storage elements.
@begin{Reason}
The index subtype of Storage_Array is Storage_Offset
because we wish to allow maximum flexibility.
Most Storage_Arrays will probably have a lower bound of 0 or 1,
but other lower bounds, including negative ones,
make sense in some situations.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Deleted],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
@ChgDeleted{Version=[2],Text=[Note that there are some language-defined

These will raise Constraint_Error if the resulting Last value is not in

For example, on a segmented architecture,
X < Y might raise Program_Error if X and Y do not point at the same

Similarly, on a segmented architecture,
the conversions between Integer_Address and Address
might not make sense for some values,
and so might raise Program_Error.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Reason}
We considered making Storage_Element a private type.
However, it is better to declare it as a modular type in the visible part,
since code that uses it is already low level,
and might as well have access to the underlying representation.
We also considered allowing Storage_Element to be any
integer type, signed integer or modular, but it is better to have
uniformity across implementations in this regard, and viewing storage elements
as unsigned seemed to make the most sense.
@end{Reason}
@begin{ImplNote}
To_Address is intended for use in Address clauses.
Implementations should overload To_Address if appropriate.

it might make sense to have a record type representing a

converts from that record type to type Address.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0005-1]}
The programmer should ensure that
the address passed to To_Pointer is either Null_Address,
or the address of an object of type Object. @Chg{Version=[2],New=[(If Object is
not a @Chg{Version=[3],New=[],Old=[not ]}by-reference type, the object ought to

Otherwise, the behavior of the program is unspecified;
it might raise an exception or crash, for example.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Reason}
Unspecified is almost the same thing as erroneous;
they both allow arbitrarily bad behavior.
We don't say erroneous here, because the implementation
might allow the address passed to To_Pointer to point
at some memory that just happens to @lquotes@;look like@rquotes@; an
object of type Object.
That's not necessarily an error; it's just not portable.
However, if the actual type passed to Object is (for example)
an array type, the programmer
would need to be aware of any dope that the implementation expects to
exist, when passing an address that did not come from the Address
attribute of an object of type Object.

One might wonder why To_Pointer and To_Address are any better than
unchecked conversions. The answer is that Address does not necessarily
have the same representation as an access type. For example, an access
value might point at the bounds of an array when an address would point
at the first element. Or an access value might be an offset in words
from someplace, whereas an address might be an offset in bytes from the
beginning of memory.
@end{Reason}
@end{StaticSem}

@begin{ImplPerm}
An implementation may place restrictions on instantiations of
Address_To_Access_Conversions.
@begin{Ramification}
For example, if the hardware requires aligned loads and stores,
then dereferencing an access value that is not properly aligned might
raise an exception.

For another example,
if the implementation has chosen to use negative component offsets
(from an access value),
it might not be possible to preserve the semantics,
since negative offsets from the Address are not allowed.
(The Address attribute always points at
@lquotes@;the first of the storage elements....@rquotes@;)
Note that while the implementation knows how to convert an access
value into an address, it might not be able to do the reverse.
To avoid generic contract model violations,
the restriction might have to be detected at run time in some cases.

The reason we allow access objects, and objects containing subcomponents of an

value cannot necessarily be determined merely by looking at the bits of
the object.
The reason we allow scalar objects to become abnormal is that we wish to
allow the compiler to optimize assuming that the value of a scalar
object belongs to the object's subtype,
if the compiler can prove that the object is initialized with a value
that belongs to the subtype.
The reason we allow composite objects to become abnormal
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[if some constraints are nonstatic ]}is
that such object might be represented with implicit levels of indirection;
if those are corrupted, then even assigning into a component of the

In a typical implementation, every bit pattern that fits in an object of
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[a signed],Old=[an]} integer subtype will represent a
value of the type, if not of the subtype.
However, for an enumeration or floating point type,@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ as

there are typically bit patterns that do not represent any
value of the type.
In such cases, the implementation ought to define the semantics of
operations on the invalid representations in the obvious manner
(assuming the bounded error is not detected):
a given representation should be equal to itself,
a representation that is in between the internal codes of
two enumeration literals should behave accordingly when passed to
comparison operators and membership tests, etc.
We considered @i{requiring} such sensible behavior,
but it resulted in too much arcane verbiage,
and since implementations have little incentive to behave
irrationally, such verbiage is not important to have.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00167-01]}
If a stand-alone scalar object is initialized to a an in-range
value, then the implementation can take advantage of the fact
that @Chg{Version=[2],New=[the use of ],Old=[]}any out-of-range value
has to be @Chg{Version=[2],New=[erroneous],Old=[abnormal]}.@ChgNote{Do you

of an assignment due to abort or to failure of a

This depends on out-of-range values being checked before
assignment (that is, checks are not optimized away unless they

  Safe_Convert is not erroneous. The result object is an object of subtype

These storage elements should be reserved at the place of the
Storage_Size clause,
so that @nt{allocator}s cannot raise Storage_Error due to running out
of pool space until the appropriate number of storage elements has
been used up.
This approximate (possibly rounded-up) value should be used as a maximum;
the implementation should not increase the size of the pool on the fly.

@end{ImplNote}
@end{ImplAdvice}

@begin{Notes}
A user-defined storage pool type can be obtained by extending the
Root_Storage_Pool type,
and overriding the primitive subprograms Allocate, Deallocate, and
Storage_Size.
A user-defined storage pool can then be obtained by declaring
an object of the type extension.
The user can override Initialize and Finalize if there is any need
for nontrivial initialization and finalization for a user-defined
pool type.
For example, Finalize might reclaim blocks of storage that are allocated
separately from the pool object itself.

@Leading@;The writer of the user-defined allocation and deallocation
procedures, and users of @nt{allocator}s for the associated access
type, are responsible for dealing with any interactions with
tasking. In particular:
@begin{itemize}
  If the @nt{allocator}s are used in different tasks, they require
mutual exclusion.

 If they are used inside protected objects, they cannot block.

 If they are used by interrupt handlers
(see @RefSec{Interrupt Support}),
the mutual exclusion mechanism has to work properly in that context.
 @end{itemize}

The primitives Allocate, Deallocate, and Storage_Size are declared as
abstract (see @RefSecNum{Abstract Types and Subprograms}),
and therefore they have to be overridden when
a new (nonabstract) storage pool type is declared.
@begin{Ramification}
Note that the Storage_Pool attribute denotes an object,
rather than a value,
which is somewhat unusual for attributes.

The calls to Allocate, Deallocate, and Storage_Size are dispatching
calls @em this follows from the fact that the actual parameter for
Pool is T'Storage_Pool, which is of type Root_Storage_Pool'Class. In
many cases (including all cases in which Storage_Pool is not
specified), the compiler can determine the tag statically.
However, it is possible to construct cases where it cannot.

All access types in the same derivation class share the same pool,
whether implementation defined or user defined.
This is necessary because we allow type conversions among them
(even if they are pool-specific),
and we want pool-specific access values to always designate
an element of the right pool.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{ImplNote}
If an access type has a standard storage pool,
then the implementation doesn't actually have to follow the pool
interface described here,
since this would be semantically invisible.
For example, the allocator could conceivably be implemented with inline
code.
@end{ImplNote}
@end{Notes}

@begin{Examples}
@Leading@;To associate an access type with a storage pool object, the user
first declares a pool object of some type derived from
Root_Storage_Pool. Then, the user defines its Storage_Pool
attribute, as follows:

@begin{Example}
Pool_Object : Some_Storage_Pool_Type;

@key[type] T @key[is] @key[access] Designated;
@key[for] T'Storage_Pool @key[use] Pool_Object;
@end{Example}

@begin{WideAbove}
@Leading@;Another access type may be added to an existing storage pool, via:
@end{WideAbove}
@begin{Example}
@key[for] T2'Storage_Pool @key[use] T'Storage_Pool;
@end{Example}

The semantics of this is implementation defined
for a standard storage pool.
@begin{Reason}
For example, the implementation is allowed to choose a storage pool
for T that takes advantage of the fact that T is of a certain size.
If T2 is not of that size, then the above will probably not work.
@end{Reason}

@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Restrictions intended for use when constructing

An implementation has to enforce the restrictions in cases where
enforcement is required,

efficiency.
@begin{Discussion}
It is not the intent that an implementation will support a different
run-time system for every possible combination of restrictions.
An implementation might support only two run-time systems,
and document a set of restrictions that is sufficient to allow
use of the more efficient and safe one.

@Defn{stream}
@Defn{stream type}
A @i{stream} is a sequence of elements comprising values from
possibly different types and allowing sequential access to these values.
A @i{stream type} is a type in the class whose root type is
Streams.Root_Stream_Type.
A stream type may be implemented in various ways,
such as an external sequential file, an internal buffer,
or a network channel.
@begin{Discussion}
A stream element will often be the same size as a storage element,
but that is not required.

@LabeledSubClause{The Package Streams}

@begin{StaticSem}
The abstract type Root_Stream_Type is the root type of the class of
stream types. The types in this class represent different kinds of
streams. A new stream type is defined by extending the root type
(or some other stream type), overriding the Read and Write
operations, and optionally defining additional primitive
subprograms,
according to the requirements of the particular kind of stream.
The predefined stream-oriented attributes like T'Read and T'Write
make dispatching
calls on the Read and Write procedures of the Root_Stream_Type.
(User-defined T'Read and T'Write attributes can also make such calls,
or can call the Read and Write attributes of other types.)

@ISOOnlyRMNewPageVer{Version=[3]}@Comment{For ISO version of Ada 2012 Standard}
@LabeledClause{Freezing Rules}

@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@redundant[This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]} defines
a place in the program text where each declared entity becomes
@lquotes@;frozen.@rquotes@;
A use of an entity, such as a reference to it by name,
or (for a type) an expression of the type,
causes freezing of the entity in some contexts,
as described below.
The @LegalityTitle forbid certain kinds of uses of an entity
in the region of text where it is frozen.]
@begin{Reason}
This concept has two purposes: a compile-time one and a run-time one.

The compile-time purpose of the freezing rules comes from the fact that
the evaluation of static expressions depends on overload resolution,
and overload resolution sometimes depends on the value of a
static expression.
(The dependence of static evaluation upon overload resolution is
obvious. The dependence in the other direction is more subtle.
There are three rules that require static expressions in contexts that
can appear in declarative places: The expression in an
@nt{attribute_designator} shall be static.
In a record aggregate, variant-controlling discriminants shall be static.
In an array aggregate with more than one named association,
the choices shall be static.
The compiler needs to know the value of these expressions in order to
perform overload resolution and legality checking.)
We wish to allow a compiler to evaluate static expressions when it sees
them in a single pass over the @nt{compilation_unit}.
The freezing rules ensure that.

The run-time purpose of the freezing rules is called the @lquotes@;linear
elaboration model.@rquotes@;
This means that declarations are elaborated in the order in which they
appear in the program text,
and later elaborations can depend on the results of earlier ones.
The elaboration of the declarations of certain entities requires run-time
information about the implementation details of other entities.
The freezing rules ensure that this information has been calculated by
the time it is used.
For example, suppose the initial value of a constant is the result of
a function call that takes a parameter of type @i(T).
In order to pass that parameter, the size of type @i(T) has to be known.
If @i(T) is composite, that size might be known only at run time.

(Note that in these discussions, words like @lquotes@;before@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;after@rquotes@;
generally refer to places in the program text,
as opposed to times at run time.)
@end{Reason}
@begin{Discussion}
@leading@;The @lquotes@;implementation details@rquotes@; we're talking
about above are:
@begin{Itemize}
For a tagged type,
the implementations of all the primitive subprograms of the type
@em that is (in the canonical implementation model),
the contents of the type descriptor, which contains pointers to the code for
each primitive subprogram.

For a type, the full type declaration of any parts (including the type itself)
that are private.

For a deferred constant,
the full constant declaration, which gives the constant's value.
(Since this information necessarily comes after the constant's type
and subtype are fully
known, there's no need to worry about its type or subtype.)

For any entity,
representation information specified by the user
via representation items.
Most representation items are for types
or subtypes; however, various other kinds of entities,
such as objects and subprograms, are possible.
@end{Itemize}

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0005-1]}
Similar issues arise for incomplete types.
However, we do not use freezing @Chg{Version=[3],
New=[to prevent premature access],Old=[there]};
incomplete types have different, more severe, restrictions.
Similar issues also arise for subprograms, protected operations,
tasks and generic units.

New=[to prevent premature access for those,],Old=[there]} either;
@RefSecNum{Declarative Parts} prevents problems with run-time
Elaboration_Checks.@Chg{Version=[3],New=[ Even so, freezing is used for these
entities to prevent giving representation items too late (that is, after uses
that require representation information, such as calls).],Old=[]}
@end{Discussion}
@end{Intro}

@begin{MetaRules}
An evaluable construct should freeze anything that's needed to evaluate
it.

However, if the construct is not evaluated where it appears,
let it cause freezing later, when it is evaluated.
This is the case for @nt{default_expression}s and @nt{default_name}s.
(Formal parameters, generic formal parameters, and components can have
@nt{default_expression}s or @nt{default_name}s.)

The compiler should be allowed to evaluate static expressions without
knowledge of their context. (I.e. there should not be any special
rules for static expressions that happen to occur in a context that
requires a static expression.)

Compilers should be allowed to evaluate static expressions (and record
the results) using the run-time representation of the type.
For example, suppose Color'Pos(Red) = 1, but the internal code for Red
is 37.
If the value of a static expression is Red,
some compilers might store 1 in their symbol table,
and other compilers might store 37.
Either compiler design should be feasible.

Compilers should never be required to detect erroneousness or exceptions at
compile time (although it's very nice if they do).
This implies that we should not require
code-generation for a nonstatic expression of type @i(T) too early,
even if we can prove that that expression will be erroneous,
or will raise an exception.

@Leading@;Here's an example (modified from AI83-00039, Example 3):
@begin{example}
@key[type] T @key[is]
    @key[record]
        ...
    @key[end] @key[record];
@key[function] F @key[return] T;
@key[function] G(X : T) @key[return] Boolean;
Y : Boolean := G(F); --@RI{ doesn't force T in Ada 83}
@key[for] T @key[use]
    @key[record]
        ...
    @key[end] @key[record];
@end{example}

@Leading@;AI83-00039 says this is legal.
Of course, it raises Program_Error because the function bodies aren't
elaborated yet. A one-pass compiler has to generate code for an expression of
type T before it knows the representation of T.
Here's a similar example, which AI83-00039 also says is legal:
@begin{example}
@key[package] P @key[is]
    @key[type] T @key[is] @key[private];
    @key[function] F @key[return] T;
    @key[function] G(X : T) @key[return] Boolean;
    Y : Boolean := G(F); --@RI{ doesn't force T in Ada 83}
@key[private]
    @key[type] T @key[is]
        @key[record]
            ...
        @key[end] @key[record];
@key[end] P;
@end{example}

If T's size were dynamic, that size would be stored in some
compiler-generated dope; this dope would be initialized at the place
of the full type declaration.
However, the generated code for the function calls
would most likely allocate a temp of the size specified by the dope
@i{before} checking for Program_Error.
That dope would contain uninitialized junk,
resulting in disaster.
To avoid doing that,
the compiler would have to determine,
at compile time, that the expression will raise Program_Error.

This is silly. If we're going to require compilers to detect the exception at
compile time, we might as well formulate the rule as a legality rule.

Compilers should not be required to generate code to load the value
of a variable before the address of the variable has been determined.

After an entity has been frozen, no further requirements may be
placed on its representation (such as by a representation item
or a @nt{full_type_declaration}).

@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
  @ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0300-1]}
  The reason bodies cause freezing is because we want
  @ntf{proper_bodies} and @nt{body_stub}s to be interchangeable @em one
  should be able to move a @nt{proper_body} to a @nt{subunit}, and
  vice@Chg{Version=[5],New=[ ],Old=[-]}versa, without changing the semantics.
  Clearly, anything that should cause freezing should do so even if
  it's inside a @nt{proper_body}.
  However, if we make it a @nt{body_stub}, then the compiler can't
  see that thing that should cause freezing.
  So we make @nt{body_stub}s cause freezing, just in case they
  contain something that should cause freezing.
  But that means we need to do the same for @ntf{proper_bodies}.

  Another reason for bodies to cause freezing,
  there could be an added implementation burden if an entity
  declared in an enclosing @nt<declarative_part> is frozen
  within a nested body,
  since some compilers look at bodies after looking
  at the containing @nt{declarative_part}.

We considered making enumeration literals never cause freezing,

In Ada 95, the declaration of X freezes Composite
(because it contains an expression of that type),
which in turn freezes T (even though Ct does not exist in this
particular case).
But type T is not completely defined at that point,
violating the rule that a type shall be completely defined before it
is frozen.
In Ada 83, on the other hand, there is no occurrence of the name T,

@begin{Legality}

@Comment{"Leading" below is to get the last paragraph onto the page with everything else.}
@Leading@Redundant[The explicit declaration of a primitive subprogram of a
tagged type shall occur before the type is frozen
(see @RefSecNum{Dispatching Operations of Tagged Types}).]
@begin{Reason}
This rule is needed
because (1) we don't want people dispatching to things that haven't
been declared yet, and (2) we want to allow tagged type descriptors
to be static (allocated statically, and initialized to link-time-known
symbols). Suppose T2 inherits primitive P from T1, and then
overrides P. Suppose P is called @i{before} the declaration of the
overriding P. What should it dispatch to? If the answer is the new
P, we've violated the first principle above. If the answer is the
old P, we've violated the second principle. (A call
to the new one necessarily raises Program_Error, but that's
beside the point.)

Note that a call upon a dispatching operation of type @i(T) will freeze @i(T).

We considered applying this rule to all derived types, for uniformity.
However, that would be upward incompatible, so we rejected the idea.
As in Ada 83, for an untagged type, the above call upon P will call the
old P (which is arguably confusing).

From RM83-13.1(7). The wording here forbids freezing
within the @Chg{New=[@nt{aspect_clause}],Old=[@nt{representation_clause}]}
itself, which was not true of the Ada 83 wording.
The wording of this rule is carefully written to
work properly for type-related representation items.
For example, an @nt{enumeration_@!representation_@!clause} is illegal after the
type is frozen, even though the @ntf{_clause} refers to the first subtype.

@end{TheProof}
@begin{Discussion}
@Leading@;Here's an example that illustrates when freezing occurs in the
presence of defaults:
@begin{Example}
@key[type] T @key[is] ...;
@key[function] F @key[return] T;
@key[type] R @key[is]
    @key[record]
        C : T := F;
        D : Boolean := F = F;
    @key[end] @key[record];
X : R;
@end{Example}

Since the elaboration of R's declaration does not allocate component C,
there is no need to freeze C's subtype at that place.
Similarly, since the elaboration of R does not evaluate the
@nt{default_expression} @lquotes@;F = F@rquotes@;, there is no need to freeze the types
involved at that point.
However, the declaration of X @i{does} need to freeze these things.
Note that even if component C did not exist, the elaboration of the
declaration of X would still need information about T @em even though
D is not of type T,
its @nt{default_expression} requires that information.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
Although we define freezing in terms of the program text as a whole
(i.e. after applying the rules of @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Program Structure and Compilation Issues}),
the freezing rules actually have no effect beyond compilation unit boundaries.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
That is important, because @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Program Structure and Compilation Issues} allows some
implementation definedness in the order of things,
and we don't want the freezing rules to be implementation defined.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
These rules also have no effect in @nt{statement}s @em they only apply within
a single @nt{declarative_part}, @nt{package_specification},
@nt{task_definition},
@nt{protected_definition},
or @nt{protected_body}.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{ImplNote}
An implementation may choose to generate code for
@nt{default_expression}s and @nt{default_name}s in
line at the place of use.
@Defn{thunk}
Alternatively, an implementation may choose to generate thunks
(subprograms implicitly generated by the compiler)
for evaluation of defaults.
Thunk generation cannot, in general, be done at the place of the
declaration that includes the default.
Instead, they can be generated at the first freezing point of the
type(s) involved.
(It is impossible to write a purely one-pass Ada compiler,
for various reasons.
This is one of them @em the compiler needs to store a representation of
defaults in its symbol table, and then walk that representation later,
no earlier than the first freezing point.)

In implementation terms, the linear elaboration model can be thought of
as preventing uninitialized dope.
For example, the implementation might generate dope to contain the size
of a private type.
This dope is initialized at the place where the type becomes
completely defined.
It cannot be initialized earlier,
because of the order-of-elaboration rules.
The freezing rules prevent elaboration of earlier declarations from
accessing the size dope for a private type before it is initialized.

@RefSecNum{Pragmas} overrides the freezing rules in the case of
unrecognized @nt{pragma}s.

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
@Chg{New=[An @nt{aspect_clause}],Old=[A @nt{representation_clause}]} for
an entity should most certainly @i{not} be a freezing point for the entity.

@begin{Incompatible83}
@Defn{incompatibilities with Ada 83}
RM83 defines a forcing occurrence of a type as follows:
@lquotes@;A forcing occurrence is any occurrence [of the name of the type,
subtypes of the type, or types or subtypes with subcomponents of the type]
other than in a type or subtype
declaration, a subprogram specification, an entry declaration, a deferred
constant declaration, a @nt{pragma}, or a @ntf{representation_clause} for the type
itself. In any case, an occurrence within an expression is always forcing.@rquotes@;

@Leading@;It seems like the wording allows things like this:
@begin{Example}
@key[type] A @key[is] @key[array](Integer @key[range] 1..10) @key[of] Boolean;
@key[subtype] S @key[is] Integer @key[range] A'Range;
    --@RI{ not forcing for A}
@end{Example}

Occurrences within @nt{pragma}s can cause freezing in Ada 95.
(Since such @nt{pragma}s are ignored in Ada 83,
this will probably fix more bugs than it causes.)
@end{Incompatible83}

@begin{Extend83}
@Leading@;@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
In Ada 95, @nt{generic_formal_parameter_declaration}s
do not normally freeze the entities from which they are defined.
For example:
@begin{example}
@key[package] Outer @key[is]
    @key[type] T @key[is] @key[tagged] @key[limited] @key[private];
    @key[generic]
        @key[type] T2 @key[is]
            @key[new] T @key[with] @key[private]; --@RI{ Does not freeze T}
                                --@RI{ in Ada 95.}
    @key[package] Inner @key[is]
        ...
    @key[end] Inner;
@key[private]
    @key[type] T @key[is] ...;
@key[end] Outer;
@end{example}

This is important for the usability of generics.
The above example uses the Ada 95 feature of formal derived types.
Examples using the kinds of formal parameters already allowed in
Ada 83 are well known.
See, for example, comments 83-00627 and 83-00688.
The extensive use expected for formal derived types
makes this issue even more compelling
than described by those comments.
Unfortunately, we are unable to solve the problem that
@nt{explicit_generic_actual_parameter}s cause freezing, even though a package
equivalent to the instance would not cause freezing.
This is primarily because such an equivalent package would have its
body in the body of the containing program unit, whereas an instance
has its body right there.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The concept of freezing is based on Ada 83's concept of @lquotes@;forcing
occurrences.@rquotes@;
The first freezing point of an entity
corresponds roughly to the place of the first forcing occurrence, in Ada
83 terms.
The reason for changing the terminology is that the new rules do not
refer to any particular @lquotes@;occurrence@rquotes@; of a name of an entity.
Instead, we refer to @lquotes@;uses@rquotes@; of an entity,
which are sometimes implicit.

In Ada 83, forcing occurrences were used only in rules about
@ntf{representation_clause}s.
We have expanded the concept to cover private types,
because the rules stated in RM83-7.4.1(4) are almost identical to the
forcing occurrence rules.

@Leading@;The Ada 83 rules are changed in Ada 95 for the following reasons:
@begin{Itemize}
The Ada 83 rules do not work right for subtype-specific aspects.
In an earlier version of Ada 9X, we considered allowing representation
items to apply to subtypes other than the first subtype.
This was part of the reason for changing the Ada 83 rules.
However, now that we have dropped that functionality,
we still need the rules to be different from the Ada 83 rules.

The Ada 83 rules do not achieve the intended effect.
In Ada 83, either with or without the AIs,
it is possible to force the compiler to generate code that references
uninitialized dope, or force it to detect erroneousness and exception
raising at compile time.

It was a goal of Ada 83 to avoid uninitialized access values.
However, in the case of deferred constants, this goal was not achieved.

The Ada 83 rules are not only too weak @em they are also too strong.
They allow loopholes (as described above),
but they also prevent certain kinds of @nt{default_expression}s that are
harmless,
and certain kinds of @nt{generic_declaration}s that are both harmless
and very useful.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
Ada 83 had a case where @Chg{Version=[2],New=[an @nt{aspect_clause}],
Old=[a @nt{representation_clause}]} had a strong
effect on the semantics of the program @em 'Small.
This caused certain semantic anomalies.
There are more cases in Ada 95,
because the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt{attribute_definition_clause}],
Old=[@ntf{attribute_representation_clause}]} has been generalized.
