@begin(itemize)
the activation and termination of a task;

a call on a protected subprogram of a @i(protected object),
providing exclusive read-write access, or concurrent read-only
access to shared data;

a call on an entry, either of another task,
allowing for synchronous communication with that task,
or of a protected object, allowing for asynchronous
communication with one or more other tasks using that same protected
object;

a timed operation, including a simple delay statement,
a timed entry call or accept, or a timed asynchronous
select statement (see next
item);

an asynchronous transfer of control as part of an asynchronous
select statement, where a task
stops what it is doing and begins execution at a different
point in response to the completion of an entry call or
the expiration of a delay;

an abort statement, allowing one task to cause the
termination of another task.
@end(itemize)

In addition, tasks can communicate indirectly by
reading and updating (unprotected) shared
variables, presuming the access is properly synchronized through
some other kind of task interaction.

  The means for selecting which of the ready tasks to run,

@begin{Notes}
@ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0119-1]}
Concurrent task execution may be implemented on
multicomputers, multiprocessors, or with interleaved execution on a single
physical processor. On the other hand, whenever an implementation can
determine that the required semantic effects can be achieved when
parts of the execution of a
@Chg{Version=[5],New=[single logical thread of control],Old=[given task]}
are performed by different physical processors acting in
parallel, it may choose to perform them in this way.

@end{Notes}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The introduction has been rewritten.

We use the term "concurrent" rather than "parallel" when talking
about logically independent execution of threads of control.
The term "parallel" is reserved for referring to the
situation where multiple physical processors run simultaneously.

@Defn{task declaration}
A task unit is declared by a @i(task declaration), which has
a corresponding @nt<task_body>. A task declaration may be
a @nt<task_type_declaration>, in which case it declares
a named task type; alternatively, it may be a @nt<single_task_declaration>,
in which case it defines an anonymous task type, as well as declaring
a named task object of that type.

@begin{Notes}

The full view of a limited private type can be a task type, or
can have subcomponents of a task type. Creation of an object of
such a type creates dependences according to the full type.

An @nt<object_renaming_declaration> defines a new view of an
existing entity and hence creates no further dependence.

The rules given for the collective completion of a group
of tasks all blocked on @nt<select_statement>s with
open @nt<terminate_alternative>s ensure that the collective
completion can occur only when there are no remaining active
tasks that could call one of the tasks being collectively completed.

If two or more tasks are blocked on @nt<select_statement>s
with open @nt{terminate_alternative}s, and become
completed collectively, their finalization actions proceed concurrently.

@leading@keepnext@;The completion of a task can occur due to any of the following:
@begin{itemize}
the raising of an exception during the elaboration of the
@nt{declarative_part} of the corresponding @nt{task_body};

the completion of the

@nt{task_body};

the selection of
an open @nt<terminate_alternative> of a @nt<select_statement>

the abort of the task.

@begin{DiffWord83}
We have revised the wording to be consistent with the definition
of master now given in @RefSec(Completion and Finalization).

Tasks that used to depend on library packages in Ada 83, now depend on the
(implicit) @nt<task_body> of the
environment task (see @RefSecNum(Program Execution)).
Therefore, the environment task has to wait for
them before performing library level finalization and terminating
the partition.
In Ada 83 the requirement to wait for tasks that depended
on library packages was not as clear.

What was "collective termination" is now "collective completion"
resulting from selecting @nt<terminate_alternative>s. This is because
finalization still occurs for such tasks, and this happens after
selecting the @nt<terminate_alternative>, but before termination.

Within the declaration or body of a protected unit@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ other
than in an @nt{access_definition}],Old=[]}, the name of
the protected unit denotes the current instance of the unit
(see @RefSecNum(The Context of Overload Resolution)),
rather than the first subtype of the corresponding protected type (and
thus the name cannot be used as a @nt<subtype_mark>).
@begin(Discussion)
  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00382-01]}
  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[It can be used as a @nt{subtype_mark} in an anonymous

  some other subtype of the protected type within its body,
  presuming such a subtype has been

@end(Discussion)

A @nt<selected_component> can be used to denote a discriminant
of a protected object (see @RefSecNum(Selected Components)).
Within a protected unit, the name of a discriminant of the protected type
denotes the corresponding discriminant of the current instance
of the unit.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00287-01]}
A protected type is a limited type (see @RefSecNum(Limited Types)),
and hence @Chg{Version=[2],New=[precludes use of @nt{assignment_statement}s and],
Old=[has neither an assignment operation nor]} predefined equality operators.

The bodies of the protected operations given in the @nt<protected_body>
define the actions that take place upon calls to the protected operations.

The declarations in the private part are only
visible within the private part and the body of the
protected unit.
@begin{Reason}
@nt{Component_declaration}s are disallowed in a @nt{protected_body}
because, for efficiency, we wish to allow the compiler to
determine the size of protected objects (when not dynamic);
the compiler cannot necessarily see the body.
Furthermore, the semantics of initialization of such objects would be
problematic @em we do not wish to give protected objects complex
initialization semantics similar to task activation.

The same applies to @nt{entry_declaration}s,
since an entry involves an implicit component @em the entry queue.

For the execution of a call on a protected subprogram,
the evaluation of the @nt<name> or @nt<prefix>

proceeds as for a normal subprogram call (see @RefSecNum{Subprogram Calls}).
If the call is an internal call (see @RefSecNum(Intertask Communication)),
the body of the subprogram
is executed as for a normal subprogram call.
If the call is an external call, then
the body of the subprogram is executed as part of a new
@i(protected action) on the target protected object;
the protected action completes after the body of the

@end{Discussion}

The body of a protected unit may contain declarations and bodies for local
subprograms. These are not visible outside the protected unit.

The body of a protected function can contain internal calls
on other protected functions, but not protected procedures,
because the current instance is a constant.
On the other hand, the body of a protected procedure
can contain internal calls on both protected functions and procedures.

From within a protected action,
an internal call on a protected subprogram,
or an external call on a protected subprogram with a different
target object is not considered a potentially blocking operation.
@begin(Reason)
  This is because a task is not considered blocked
  while attempting to acquire the execution resource associated with
  a protected object. The acquisition of such a resource
  is rather considered part of the normal competition for execution
  resources between the various tasks that are ready.
  External calls that turn out to be on the same target
  object are considered potentially blocking, since they
  can deadlock the task indefinitely.

@begin{Legality}

An @nt<entry_declaration> in a task declaration shall not contain
a specification for an access parameter (see @RefSecNum(Access Types)).
@begin(Reason)
  @leading@;Access parameters for task entries would require a complex
  implementation. For example:
  @begin(Example)
@key(task) T @key(is)
   @key(entry) E(Z : @key(access) Integer); --@RI{ Illegal!}
@key(end) T;

@key(task body) T @key(is)
@key(begin)
   @key(declare)
      @key(type) A @key(is access all) Integer;
      X : A;
      Int : @key(aliased) Integer;
      @key(task) Inner;
      @key(task body) Inner @key(is)
      @key(begin)
         T.E(Int'Access);
      @key(end) Inner;
   @key(begin)
      @key(accept) E(Z : @key(access) Integer) @key(do)
         X := A(Z); --@RI{ Accessibility_Check}
      @key(end) E;
   @key(end);
@key(end) T;
@end(Example)

Implementing the Accessibility_Check inside the @nt<accept_statement> for
E is difficult, since one does not know whether the entry caller
is calling from inside the immediately enclosing declare block or from
outside it. This means that the lexical nesting level associated with
the designated object is not sufficient to determine whether the
Accessibility_Check should pass or fail.

Note that such problems do not arise with protected entries, because
@ntf<entry_bodies> are always nested immediately within the
@nt<protected_body>; they cannot be further nested as can
@nt<accept_statement>s, nor can they be called from within the
@nt<protected_body> (since no entry calls are permitted inside
a @nt<protected_body>).

@nt<Accept_statement>s are required to be immediately within
the enclosing @nt<task_body> (as opposed to being in a nested
subprogram) to ensure that a nested task does not
attempt to accept the entry of its enclosing task. We considered
relaxing this restriction, either by making the check a run-time
check, or by allowing a nested task to accept an entry of its
enclosing task. However, neither change seemed to provide sufficient
benefit to justify the additional implementation burden.

are prohibited to ensure that there is no ambiguity in the
resolution of an expanded name for a formal parameter of the
entry. This could be relaxed by allowing the inner
one to hide the outer one from all visibility, but again the
small added benefit didn't seem to justify making the change for Ada 95.

@nt<Accept_statement>s are not permitted within @nt<asynchronous_select>
statements to simplify the semantics and implementation:
an @nt<accept_statement> in an @nt<abortable_part> could result
in Tasking_Error being propagated from an entry call even though
the target task was still callable; implementations that use
multiple tasks implicitly to implement an @nt<asynchronous_select>
might have trouble supporting "up-level" accepts.
Furthermore, if @nt<accept_statement>s were permitted in
the @nt<abortable_part>, a task could call its own
entry and then accept it in the @nt<abortable_part>, leading
to rather unusual and possibly difficult-to-specify semantics.

@Defn2{Term=[Program_Error],Sec=(raised by barrier failure)}
If the evaluation of the @nt<condition> propagates an exception, the

to all current callers of all entries of the protected object.
@begin(Reason)
  An exception during barrier evaluation is considered essentially
  a fatal error. All current entry callers are notified with a Program_Error.
  In a fault-tolerant system, a protected object might provide a Reset
  protected procedure, or equivalent, to support attempts to restore such
  a "broken" protected object to a reasonable state.
@end(Reason)
@end(Itemize)
@begin(Discussion)
  Note that the definition of when a task entry is open is
  based on the state of the (accepting) task, whereas the
  "openness" of a protected entry is defined only
  when it is explicitly checked, since the barrier expression needs to
  be evaluated. Implementation permissions are given (below) to
  allow implementations to evaluate the barrier expression more or
  less often than it is checked, but the basic semantic model presumes
  it is evaluated at the times when it is checked.
@end(Discussion)

@leading@PDefn2{Term=[execution], Sec=(entry_call_statement)}
For the execution of an @nt{entry_call_statement},
evaluation of the @nt<name>
and of the parameter associations
is as for a subprogram call (see @RefSecNum{Subprogram Calls}).
@Defn2{Term=[issue], Sec=(an entry call)}
The entry call is then @i(issued):
For a call on an entry of a protected object, a new protected
action is started on the object (see @RefSecNum(Protected Subprograms and Protected Actions)).
The named entry is checked to see if it is open;
@Defn2{Term=[select an entry call], Sec=(immediately)}
if open, the entry call is said to be @i(selected immediately),
and the execution of the call proceeds as follows:
@begin(Itemize)
  For a call on an open entry of a task, the accepting task becomes ready and
  continues the execution of the corresponding @nt<accept_statement>
  (see @RefSecNum(Entries and Accept Statements)).

  For a call on an open entry of a protected object, the corresponding
  @nt<entry_body> is executed (see @RefSecNum(Entries and Accept Statements))
  as part of the protected action.
@end(Itemize)

If the @nt<accept_statement> or @nt<entry_body> completes other than
by a requeue (see @RefSecNum(Requeue Statements)), return is made to the
caller (after servicing the entry queues @em see below);
any necessary assigning back
of formal to actual parameters occurs,
as for a subprogram call (see @RefSecNum(Parameter Associations));
such assignments take
place outside of any protected action.
@begin(Ramification)
  The return to the caller will generally not occur until
  the protected action completes, unless some other thread of
  control is given the job of completing the protected action
  and releasing the associated execution resource.
@end(Ramification)

If the named entry is closed, the entry call is added to an @i(entry queue)
(as part of the protected action, for a call on a protected entry),
and the call remains queued until it is selected or cancelled;
@Defn{entry queue}
there is a separate (logical) entry queue for each entry of a
given task or protected object
@Redundant[(including each entry of an entry family)].

@Leading@Defn2{Term=[service], Sec=(an entry queue)}
@Defn2{Term=[select an entry call], Sec=(from an entry queue)}
When a queued call is @i{selected}, it is removed from its entry queue.
Selecting a queued call from a particular entry queue is
called @i{servicing} the entry queue.
An entry with queued calls can be serviced under
the following circumstances:
@begin(Itemize)
  When the associated task reaches a corresponding @nt<accept_statement>, or
  a @nt<selective_accept> with a corresponding
  open @nt<accept_alternative>;

  @ChgRef{Version=[4],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0129-1]}

  associated protected object, an
  @Chg{Version=[4],New=[exclusive protected ],Old=[]}operation
  on the object@Chg{Version=[4],New=[],Old=[ other than
  a call on a protected function]},
  the entry is checked and found to be open.
@end(Itemize)

@Defn2{Term=[select an entry call], Sec=(from an entry queue)}
If there is at least one call on a queue corresponding to
an open entry, then one such call is selected according to the
@i(entry queuing policy) in effect (see below), and the
corresponding @nt<accept_statement> or @nt<entry_body> is
executed as above for an entry call that is selected immediately.

@Defn{entry queuing policy}
The entry queuing policy controls selection among queued calls
both for task and protected entry queues.
@Defn{default entry queuing policy}
@Defn2{Term=[entry queuing policy], Sec=(default policy)}
The default entry queuing policy is to select calls on a given entry
queue in order of arrival. If calls from two or more queues are
simultaneously eligible for selection, the default entry queuing policy
does not specify which queue is serviced first.
Other entry queuing policies can be specified by @nt{pragma}s
(see @RefSecNum(Entry Queuing Policies)).

For a protected object, the above servicing of entry queues continues
until there are no open entries with queued calls, at which point
the protected action completes.
@begin(Discussion)
  While servicing the entry queues of a protected object, no new calls
  can be added to any entry queue of the object,
  except due to an internal requeue (see @RefSecNum(Requeue Statements)).
  This is because the first step of a call on a protected entry
  is to start a new protected action, which implies acquiring
  (for exclusive read-write access)
  the execution resource associated with the protected object, which cannot
  be done while another protected action is already in progress.
@end(Discussion)

@PDefn2{Term=[blocked], Sec=(during an entry call)}
For an entry call that is added to a queue,
and that is not the @nt<triggering_statement> of an
@nt<asynchronous_@!select>
(see @RefSecNum{Asynchronous Transfer of Control}),
the calling task is blocked until the call is cancelled,
or the call is selected and a corresponding @nt<accept_statement>
or @nt<entry_body> completes without requeuing.
In addition, the calling task is blocked during a rendezvous.

@begin{Ramification}

For a call on a protected entry,
the caller is not blocked if the call is selected immediately,
unless a requeue causes the call to be queued.

@end{Ramification}

@Defn2{Term=[cancellation], Sec=(of an entry call)}
An attempt can be made to cancel an entry call upon an abort
(see @RefSecNum(Abort of a Task - Abort of a Sequence of Statements))
and as part of certain forms of @nt<select_statement>
(see @RefSecNum(Timed Entry Calls),
@RefSecNum(Conditional Entry Calls), and
@RefSecNum(Asynchronous Transfer of Control)).
The cancellation does not take place until
a point (if any) when the call is on some entry queue,
and not protected from cancellation as part of a requeue
(see @RefSecNum(Requeue Statements)); at such a point, the
call is removed from the entry queue and the call completes due
to the cancellation.
The cancellation of a call on an entry of a protected object
is a protected action@Redundant[, and as such cannot take place
while any other protected action is occurring on the protected object.
Like any protected action, it includes servicing of the entry queues
(in case some entry barrier depends on a Count attribute).]
@begin(ImplNote)
  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
  In the case of an attempted cancellation due to abort,
  this removal might have to be performed by the calling task
  itself if the ceiling priority of the protected object
  is lower than the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[priority of the ],Old=[]}task
  initiating the abort.
@end(ImplNote)

@IndexCheck{Tasking_Check}
@Defn2{Term=[Tasking_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
A call on an entry of a task that has already completed its execution
raises the exception Tasking_Error at the point of the call;
similarly, this exception is raised at the point of the call if the
called task completes its execution or becomes abnormal before accepting
the call or completing the rendezvous
(see @RefSecNum(Abort of a Task - Abort of a Sequence of Statements)).
This applies equally to a simple entry call and to an entry call as part
of a @nt<select_statement>.

@end{RunTime}

@begin{ImplPerm}

An implementation may perform the sequence of steps of a protected action
using any thread of control; it need not be that of the task
that started the protected action.
If an @nt<entry_body> completes without requeuing, then the
corresponding calling task may be made ready
without waiting for the entire protected action to complete.
@begin(Reason)
  These permissions are intended to allow flexibility for implementations
  on multiprocessors. On a monoprocessor, which thread of control executes
  the protected action is essentially invisible, since the thread is
  not abortable in any case, and the "current_task" function is not
  guaranteed to work during a protected action
  (see @Chg{Version=[2],New=[@RefSecNum(The Package Task_Identification)],

@end(Reason)

@ChgRef{Version=[4],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0129-1]}

@begin(Ramification)
  @ChgRef{Version=[4],Kind=[Revised]}
  Changes to variables referenced by an entry barrier that
  result from actions outside of a
  @Chg{Version=[4],New=[],Old=[protected procedure or entry ]}call
  @Chg{Version=[4],New=[to an exclusive protected operation of],Old=[on]} the
  protected object need not be "noticed." For example, if
  a global variable is referenced by an entry barrier, it should not
  be altered (except as part of a protected action on the object) any
  time after the barrier is first evaluated.
  In other words, globals can be used to "parameterize" a protected object,
  but they cannot reliably be used to control it after the first
  use of the protected object.
@end(Ramification)
@begin{ImplNote}
  Note that even if a global variable is volatile,
  the implementation need only reevaluate a barrier if the
  global is updated during a protected action on the protected object.
  This ensures that an entry-open bit-vector implementation
  approach is possible, where the bit-vector is computed at
  the end of a protected action, rather than upon each entry call.
@end{ImplNote}

An implementation may evaluate the @nt<condition>s of all @nt<entry_barrier>s
of a given protected object any time any entry of the object
is checked to see if it is open.
@begin(Ramification)
  In other words, any side effects of evaluating an entry barrier
  should be innocuous, since an entry barrier might be evaluated more
  or less often than is implied by the "official" dynamic semantics.
@end(Ramification)
@begin(ImplNote)
  It is anticipated that when the number of entries is known to be small,
  all barriers will be evaluated any time one of them needs to be,
  to produce an "entry-open bit-vector." The appropriate bit will
  be tested when the entry is called, and only if the bit is false
  will a check be made to see whether the bit-vector might need to
  be recomputed. This should allow an implementation to maximize
  the performance of a call on an open entry, which seems like the
  most important case.

  In addition to the entry-open bit-vector, an "is-valid"
  bit is needed per object, which indicates whether the current
  bit-vector setting is valid.
  A "depends-on-Count-attribute" bit is needed per type.
  The "is-valid" bit is set to false
  (as are all the bits of the bit-vector) when the protected object is first
  created, as well as any time an exception is propagated from computing
  the bit-vector. Is-valid would also be set false any time the
  Count is changed and
  "depends-on-Count-attribute" is true for the type, or a
  protected procedure or entry returns indicating it might have updated a
  variable referenced in some barrier.

  A single procedure can be compiled to evaluate all of the barriers,
  set the entry-open bit-vector accordingly, and set the is-valid bit to true.
  It could have a "when others" handler to set them all false,
  and call a routine to propagate Program_Error to all queued callers.

  For protected types where the number of entries is not known to be
  small, it makes more sense to evaluate a barrier only when the
  corresponding entry is checked to see if it is open. It isn't worth
  saving the state of the entry between checks, because of the space
  that would be required. Furthermore, the entry queues probably want
  to take up space only when there is actually a caller on them, so
  rather than an array of all entry queues, a linked list of nonempty
  entry queues make the most sense in this case, with the first caller
  on each entry queue acting as the queue header.
@end(ImplNote)

When an attempt is made to cancel an entry call, the implementation
need not make the attempt using the thread of control of the
task (or interrupt) that initiated the cancellation; in particular,
it may use the thread of control of the caller itself to attempt the
cancellation, even if this might allow the entry call to be
selected in the interim.
@begin{Reason}
  Because cancellation of a protected entry call is a protected
  action (which helps make the Count attribute of a protected
  entry meaningful), it might
  not be practical to attempt the cancellation from the thread
  of control that initiated the cancellation. For example,
  if the cancellation is due to the expiration of a delay,
  it is unlikely that the handler of the timer interrupt could
  perform the necessary protected action itself (due to being
  on the interrupt level). Similarly, if the cancellation
  is due to an abort, it is possible that the task initiating
  the abort has a priority higher than the ceiling priority of the
  protected object (for implementations that support ceiling priorities).
  Similar considerations could apply in a multiprocessor situation.
@end{Reason}

@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{Notes}

If an exception is raised during the execution of an @nt{entry_body}, it is
propagated to the corresponding caller (see @RefSecNum(Exception Handling)).

For a call on a protected entry, the entry is checked to see if
it is open prior to queuing the call, and again thereafter
if its Count attribute (see @RefSecNum{Task and Entry Attributes})
is referenced in some entry barrier.
@begin(Ramification)
  Given this, extra care is required if
  a reference to the Count attribute of an entry
  appears in the entry's own barrier.
@end(Ramification)
@begin(Reason)
  An entry is checked to see if it is open prior to queuing
  to maximize the performance of a call on an open entry.
@end(Reason)

In addition to simple entry calls,
the language permits timed, conditional, and asynchronous entry calls
(see @RefSecNum(Timed Entry Calls), @RefSecNum(Conditional Entry Calls),
and see @RefSecNum(Asynchronous Transfer of Control)).
@begin{Ramification}
A task can call its own entries, but
the task will deadlock if the call is a simple entry call.
@end{Ramification}

The @nt<condition> of an @nt<entry_barrier> is allowed to be evaluated by
an implementation more often than strictly necessary, even if the
evaluation might have side effects. On the other hand, an implementation
need not reevaluate the @nt<condition> if nothing it references was
updated by an intervening protected action on the protected object,
even if the @nt<condition> references some global variable that might
have been updated by an action performed from outside of a protected action.

@begin(Reason)
  These restrictions ensure that the target object of the requeue outlives the

  They also prevent requeuing from a nested

  which could create some strange "long-distance" connections between

  @nt<accept_statement> of the inner @nt<task_body> on parameters of

For the execution of a requeue on an entry of a target task,

selected immediately or queued, as for a normal entry call
(see @RefSecNum(Entry Calls)).

  if the requeue is an internal requeue
  (that is, the requeue is back on an entry of the same protected object @em

  @begin(Ramification)
    Note that for an internal requeue, the call
    is queued without checking whether the target entry is open.
    This is because the entry queues will be serviced before the

@begin{Notes}

A @nt{delay_relative_statement} with a negative value of the
@i(delay_)@nt<expression> is equivalent to one with a zero value.

A @nt{delay_statement} may be executed by the environment task;
consequently @nt{delay_statement}s may be executed as part of
the elaboration of a @nt{library_item} or the execution of the main subprogram.
Such statements delay the environment task (see @RefSecNum(Program Execution)).

@PDefn2{Term=[potentially blocking operation],Sec=(delay_statement)}
@PDefn2{Term=[blocking, potentially],Sec=(delay_statement)}
A @nt{delay_statement} is an abort completion point and
a potentially blocking operation,
even if the task is not actually blocked.

There is no necessary relationship between System.Tick (the
resolution of the clock of package Calendar)
and Duration'Small (the @i(small) of type Duration).
@begin{Ramification}
The inaccuracy of the @nt{delay_statement} has no relation to System.Tick.
In particular, it is possible that the clock used for the
@nt{delay_statement} is less accurate than Calendar.Clock.

We considered making Tick a run-time-determined quantity,
to allow for easier configurability.
However, this would not be upward compatible,
and the desired configurability can be achieved using
functionality defined in @RefSec{Real-Time Systems}.

Additional requirements associated with @nt<delay_statement>s

@begin{Inconsistent83}
@Defn{inconsistencies with Ada 83}
For programs that raise Time_Error on "+" or "@en@;" in Ada 83,the exception
might be deferred until a call on Split or Year_Number, or might
not be raised at all (if the offending time is never Split after being
calculated). This should not affect typical programs,
since they deal only with times corresponding to the relatively
recent past or near future.
@end{Inconsistent83}

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The syntax rule for @nt{delay_statement} is modified to allow
@nt{delay_until_statement}s.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00351-01]}
The type Time may represent dates with year numbers outside of Year_Number.
Therefore, the operations "+" and
"@en@;" need only raise Time_Error if the result is not representable
in Time (or Duration); also, Split or Year will now raise Time_Error
if the year number is outside of Year_Number.
This change is intended to simplify the implementation
of "+" and "@en@;" (allowing them to depend on overflow for
detecting when to raise Time_Error) and to allow local
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[time zone],Old=[timezone]} information to be
considered at the time of Split rather than Clock (depending on
the implementation approach). For example, in a POSIX environment,
it is natural for the type Time to be based on GMT, and
the results of procedure Split (and the functions
Year, Month, Day, and Seconds) to depend on local time zone information.
In other environments, it is more natural for the type Time to
be based on the local time zone, with the results of
Year, Month, Day, and Seconds being pure functions of their input.

@begin{RunTime}

@Defn{open alternative}
A @nt<select_alternative> is said to be @i(open) if
it is not immediately preceded by a @nt<guard>, or if
the @nt<condition> of its @nt<guard> evaluates to True. It
is said to be @i(closed) otherwise.

@PDefn2{Term=[execution], Sec=(selective_accept)}
For the execution of a @nt{selective_accept}, any @nt{guard}
@nt{condition}s are evaluated; open alternatives are
thus determined. For an open @nt{delay_alternative}, the
@i(delay_)@nt<expression> is also evaluated. Similarly, for an open
@nt{accept_alternative} for
an entry of a family, the @nt{entry_index} is also evaluated.
These evaluations are performed in an arbitrary order, except that
a @i(delay_)@nt<expression> or @nt<entry_index> is not evaluated until
after evaluating the corresponding @nt<condition>, if any.
Selection and execution of one open alternative, or of the else part, then
completes the execution of the @nt{selective_accept}; the rules for
this selection are described below.@PDefn2{Term=[arbitrary order],Sec=[allowed]}

Open @nt{accept_alternative}s are first considered. Selection of one such
alternative takes place immediately if the corresponding
entry already has queued calls. If several alternatives
can thus be selected, one of them is selected according to the
entry queuing policy in effect (see @RefSecNum(Entry Calls) and
@RefSecNum(Entry Queuing Policies)).
When such an
alternative is selected, the selected call is
removed from its entry queue and the @nt<handled_sequence_of_@!statements>
(if any) of the corresponding @nt{accept_statement} is executed; after the
rendezvous completes any subsequent @nt<sequence_of_@!statements>
of the alternative is executed.
@PDefn2{Term=[blocked], Sec=(execution of a @nt<selective_accept>)}
If no selection is immediately possible (in the above sense)
and there is no else part, the task
blocks until an open alternative can be selected.

@leading@;Selection of the other forms of alternative or of an else part is performed
as follows:
@begin{itemize}

An open @nt{delay_alternative} is selected when
its expiration time is reached if no @nt{accept_@!alternative}
or other @nt<delay_@!alternative> can be selected prior to the
expiration time. If several
@nt{delay_@!alternative}s have this same expiration time,
one of them is selected according to the queuing policy in
effect (see @RefSecNum{Entry Queuing Policies}); the default queuing
policy chooses arbitrarily among the @nt<delay_@!alternative>s
whose expiration time has passed.

The else part is selected and its @nt<sequence_of_@!statements> is executed
if no @nt{accept_alternative} can immediately be selected;
in particular, if all alternatives are closed.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
An open @nt{terminate_alternative} is selected if the conditions stated at the
end of @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}
@RefSecNum{Task Dependence - Termination of Tasks}
are satisfied.
@begin(Ramification)
  In the absence of a @nt<requeue_statement>, the conditions stated
  are such that a @nt<terminate_alternative> cannot be selected while
  there is a queued entry call for any entry of the task.
  In the presence of requeues from a task to one of its subtasks,

  We currently don't specify when the by-copy [@key(in)] @key(out)

  requiring that to happen after the @nt<abortable_part> is
  left. However, that doesn't seem useful enough
  to justify possibly overspecifying the implementation approach,
  since some of the parameters are passed by reference anyway.

  In an earlier description, we required that the @nt<sequence_of_@!statements>
  of the @nt<triggering_@!alternative> execute after aborting
  the @nt<abortable_part>, but before waiting for it to complete
  and finalize, to provide more rapid response to the triggering event
  in case the finalization was unbounded. However, various reviewers felt
  that this created unnecessary complexity in the description,
  and a potential for undesirable concurrency (and nondeterminism)
  within a single task. We have now reverted to simpler, more
  deterministic semantics,
  but anticipate that further discussion of this issue might be
  appropriate during subsequent reviews.
  One possibility is to leave this area implementation defined,
  so as to encourage experimentation. The user would then have
  to assume the worst about what kinds of actions are appropriate
  for the @nt<sequence_of_@!statements> of the @nt<triggering_@!alternative>

@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
Note that aborting those tasks is not defined to be an
abort-deferred operation.
Therefore, if one of the named tasks is the task executing the
@nt{abort_statement}, or if the task executing the
@nt{abort_statement} depends on one of the named tasks,
then it is possible for the execution of the @nt{abort_statement} to be
aborted, thus leaving some of the tasks unaborted.
This allows the implementation to use either a sequence of calls to an
@lquotes@;abort task@rquotes@; @Chg{Version=[2],New=[run-time

@leading@PDefn2{Term=[execution], Sec=(aborting the execution of a construct)}
@Defn2{Term=[abort], Sec=(of the execution of a construct)}
When the execution of a construct
is @i(aborted) (including that of a @nt<task_@!body> or of a
@nt<sequence_of_@!statements>), the execution of every construct
included within the aborted execution is also aborted,
except for executions included within the execution of an @i(abort-deferred)
operation; the execution of an abort-deferred operation
continues to completion without being affected by the abort;
@Defn{abort-deferred operation}
the following are the abort-deferred operations:
@begin(Itemize)
  a protected action;

  waiting for an entry call to complete (after having
  initiated the attempt to cancel it @em see below);

  waiting for the termination of dependent tasks;

  the execution of an Initialize procedure as the last step
  of the default initialization of a controlled object;

  the execution of a Finalize procedure as part of the
  finalization of a controlled object;

  an assignment operation to an object with a controlled part.
@end(Itemize)

@Redundant[The last three of these are discussed further in
@RefSecNum(Assignment and Finalization).]
@begin{Reason}
  Deferring abort during Initialize and finalization allows,
  for example, the result of an allocator performed in
  an Initialize operation to be assigned into an access object without
  being interrupted in the middle, which would cause storage leaks.
  For an object with several controlled parts,
  each individual Initialize is abort-deferred.
  Note that there is generally no semantic difference between
  making each Finalize
  abort-deferred, versus making a group of them abort-deferred,
  because if the task gets aborted, the first thing it will do is
  complete any remaining finalizations.
  Individual objects are finalized prior to an assignment operation
  (if nonlimited controlled) and as part of Unchecked_Deallocation.
@end{Reason}
@begin(Ramification)
Abort is deferred during the entire assignment operation
to an object with a controlled part,
even if only some subcomponents are controlled.
Note that this says "assignment operation,"
not "@nt{assignment_statement}."
Explicit calls to Initialize, Finalize, or Adjust are
not abort-deferred.
@end(Ramification)


When a master is aborted, all tasks
that depend on that master are aborted.

@PDefn{unspecified}
The order in which tasks become abnormal as the result
of an @nt<abort_statement> or the abort of a @nt<sequence_of_@!statements>
is not specified by the language.

@leading@;If the execution of an entry call is aborted,
an immediate attempt is made to cancel the entry call
(see @RefSecNum(Entry Calls)).
If the execution of a construct
is aborted at a time when the execution is blocked,
other than for an entry call, at a point that is outside
the execution of an abort-deferred operation,
then the execution of the construct completes immediately.
For an abort due to an @nt<abort_statement>,
these immediate effects occur before the execution of
the @nt<abort_statement> completes.
Other than for these immediate cases, the execution
of a construct that is aborted does not necessarily
complete before the @nt<abort_statement> completes.
However, the execution of the aborted construct
completes no later than its next @i(abort completion point) (if any)
that occurs outside of an abort-deferred operation;
@Defn{abort completion point}
the following are abort completion points for an execution:
@begin(Itemize)

  @begin(Ramification)
    Although the abort completion point doesn't occur until the end
    of the entry call or @nt<delay_statement>, these operations might
    be cut short because an abort attempts to cancel them.
  @end(Ramification)

  the start of the execution of a @nt<select_statement>,
  or of the @nt<sequence_of_@!statements> of an @nt<exception_handler>.

@PDefn2{Term=(bounded error),Sec=(cause)}
An attempt to execute an @nt<asynchronous_select> as
part of the execution of an abort-deferred operation is a bounded error.
Similarly, an attempt to create a task that depends on a master
that is included entirely within the execution of
an abort-deferred operation is a bounded error.
@Defn2{Term=[Program_Error],Sec=(raised by detection of a bounded error)}
In both cases, Program_Error is raised if the error is detected
by the implementation; otherwise@Chg{Version=[3],New=[,],Old=[]} the
operations proceed as they would outside an abort-deferred operation, except
that an abort of the @nt<abortable_part>
or the created task might or might not have an effect.
@begin(Reason)
  An @nt<asynchronous_select> relies on an abort of the
  @nt<abortable_part> to effect the
  asynchronous transfer of control. For an @nt<asynchronous_select>
  within an abort-deferred operation, the abort might
  have no effect.

  Creating a task dependent on a master included within an abort-deferred
  operation is considered an error, because such tasks could be aborted while
  the abort-deferred operation was still progressing, undermining the
  purpose of abort-deferral. Alternatively, we could say that such
  tasks are abort-deferred for their entire execution, but that seems
  too easy to abuse. Note that task creation is already a bounded error
  in protected actions, so this additional rule only applies to local task
  creation as part of Initialize, Finalize, or Adjust.

For the Count attribute, the entry can be either a single entry or an

Within task units, algorithms interrogating the attribute E'Count should
take precautions to allow for the increase of the value of this attribute
for incoming entry calls, and its decrease, for example with
@nt{timed_entry_call}s. Also, a @nt{conditional_entry_call} may briefly
increase this value, even if the conditional call is not accepted.

Within protected units, algorithms interrogating the attribute E'Count
in the @nt<entry_barrier> for the entry E should take precautions to
allow for the evaluation of the @nt<condition> of the barrier both before
and after queuing a given caller.

@LabeledClause{Example of Tasking and Synchronization}

@begin{Examples}

@Leading@;The following example defines a buffer protected object
to smooth variations between
the speed of output of a producing task and the speed of input of some
consuming task. For instance, the producing task might have the
following structure:

@begin(Example)
@key(task) Producer;

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00433-01]}
@key(task body) Producer @key(is)
   @Chg{Version=[2],New=[Person : Person_Name; --@RI[ see @RefSecNum{Incomplete Type Declarations}]],Old=[Char : Character;]}
@key(begin)
   @key(loop)
      ... --@RI[  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[simulate arrival of the next customer],Old=[produce the next character Char]}]
      Buffer.@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Append_Wait(Person)],Old=[Write(Char)]};
      @key(exit) @key(when) @Chg{Version=[2],New=[Person = @key(null)],Old=[Char = ASCII.EOT]};
   @key(end) @key(loop);
@key(end) Producer;
@end(Example)

@leading@keepnext@;and the consuming task might have the following structure:

@begin(Example)
@key(task) Consumer;

@Trailing@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00433-01]}@key(task body) Consumer @key(is)

      @key(exit) @key(when) @Chg{Version=[2],New=[Person = @key(null)],Old=[Char = ASCII.EOT]};
      ... --@RI[  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[simulate serving a customer],Old=[consume the character Char]}]
   @key(end) @key(loop);
@key(end) Consumer;
@end(Example)

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00433-01]}
The buffer object contains an internal @Chg{Version=[2],New=[array],Old=[pool]}
of @Chg{Version=[2],New=[person names],Old=[characters]} managed in a
round-robin fashion. The @Chg{Version=[2],New=[array],Old=[pool]} has two
indices, an In_Index denoting the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[index],Old=[space]}
for the next input @Chg{Version=[2],New=[person name],Old=[character]} and an
Out_Index denoting the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[index],Old=[space]} for the next
output @Chg{Version=[2],New=[person name],Old=[character]}.
