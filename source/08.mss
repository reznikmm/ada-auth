@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@redundant[The rules defining the scope of declarations and the rules defining
which @nt{identifier}s, @nt{character_literal}s, and
@nt{operator_symbol}s are visible at (or from) various places in the text of
the program are described in this @Chg{Version=[3],New=[clause],Old=[section]}.
The formulation of these rules uses the notion of a declarative region.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
As explained in @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Declarations and Types},
a declaration declares a view of an entity
and associates a defining name with that view.
The view comprises an identification of the viewed entity,
and possibly additional properties.
A usage name denotes a declaration.
It also denotes the view declared by that declaration,
and denotes the entity of that view.
Thus, two different usage names might denote two different views of
the same entity; in this case they denote the same entity.]
@begin{Honest}
In some cases, a usage name that denotes a declaration
does not denote the view declared by that declaration,
nor the entity of that view,
but instead denotes a view of the current instance of the entity,
and denotes the current instance of the entity.
This sometimes happens when the usage name occurs inside
the declarative region of the declaration.
@end{Honest}
@end{Intro}

@begin{DiffWord83}
We no longer define the term @lquotes@;basic operation;@rquotes@;
thus we no longer have to worry about the visibility of them.
Since they were essentially always visible in Ada 83, this change has
no effect. The reason for this change is that the definition in Ada
83 was confusing, and not quite correct,
and we found it difficult to fix. For example, one
wonders why an @nt{if_statement} was not a basic operation of type
Boolean. For another example, one wonders what it meant for a basic
operation to be @lquotes@;inherent in@rquotes@; something.
Finally, this fixes the problem addressed by AI83-00027/07.

@begin{WideAbove}
@leading@;The declarative region includes the text of the construct
together with additional text determined @Redundant[(recursively)],
as follows:
@end{WideAbove}
@begin{Itemize}
If a declaration is included, so is its completion, if any.

If the declaration of a library unit
@Redundant[(including Standard @em
see @RefSecNum{Compilation Units - Library Units})] is included,
so are the declarations of any child units
@Redundant[(and their completions, by the previous rule)].
The child declarations occur after the declaration.

If a @nt{body_stub} is included,
so is the corresponding @nt{subunit}.

If a @nt{type_declaration} is included,
then so is a corresponding @nt{record_representation_clause},
if any.
@begin{Reason}
This is so that the @nt{component_declaration}s can be directly
visible in the @nt{record_representation_clause}.
@end{Reason}
@end{Itemize}

The declarative region of a declaration is also called the
@i{declarative region} of any view or entity declared by the
declaration.
@begin{Reason}
The constructs that have declarative regions
are the constructs that can have declarations nested inside them.
Nested declarations are declared in that declarative region.
The one exception is for enumeration literals;
although they are nested inside an enumeration type declaration,
they behave as if they were declared at the same level as the type.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Honest}
A declarative region does not include @nt{parent_unit_name}s.
@end{Honest}
@begin{Ramification}
A declarative region does not include @nt{context_clause}s.

@Defn{occur immediately within}
@Defn{immediately within}
@Defn2{Term=[within],Sec=(immediately)}
@Defn{immediately enclosing}
@Defn2{Term=[enclosing],Sec=(immediately)}
A declaration occurs @i{immediately within} a declarative region if this
region is the innermost declarative region that
encloses the declaration
(the @i{immediately enclosing} declarative region),
not counting the declarative region (if any)
associated with the declaration itself.
@begin{Discussion}
Don't confuse the declarative region of a declaration
with the declarative region in which it immediately occurs.
@end{Discussion}

@redundant[@Defn{local to}
A declaration is @i{local} to a declarative region if
the declaration occurs immediately within the declarative region.]
@redundant[An entity is @i{local} to a declarative region if the entity is
declared by a declaration that is local to the declarative region.]
@begin{Ramification}
"Occurs immediately within" and "local to" are synonyms
(when referring to declarations).

Thus, @lquotes@;local to@rquotes@; applies to both declarations and entities,
whereas @lquotes@;occurs immediately within@rquotes@; only applies to declarations.
We use this term only informally; for cases where precision is required,
we use the term "occurs immediately within", since it is less likely to
cause confusion.
@end{Ramification}

@Defn{global to}
A declaration is @i{global} to a declarative region
if the declaration occurs immediately within
another declarative region that encloses the
declarative region.
An entity is @i{global} to a declarative region if the entity is
declared by a declaration that is global to the declarative region.
@end{StaticSem}

@begin{Notes}
The children of a parent library unit are inside the parent's
declarative region, even though they do not occur inside the
parent's declaration or body.
This implies that one can use (for example) "P.Q" to refer to
a child of P whose defining name is Q,
and that after "@key[use] P;" Q can refer (directly) to that child.

As explained above
and in @RefSec{Compilation Units - Library Units},
all library units are descendants of Standard,
and so are contained in the declarative region of Standard.
They are @i{not} inside the
declaration or body of Standard,
but they @i{are} inside its declarative region.

For a declarative region that comes in multiple parts,
the text of the declarative region does not contain any text that might appear
between the parts.
Thus, when a portion of a declarative region is said to extend from one
place to another in the declarative region,
the portion does not contain any text that
might appear between the parts of the declarative region.
@begin{Discussion}
It is necessary for the things that have a declarative region to
include
anything that contains declarations (except for enumeration type
declarations).
This includes any declaration that has a profile
(that is, @nt{subprogram_declaration},
@nt{subprogram_body},
@nt{entry_declaration},
@nt{subprogram_renaming_declaration},
@nt{formal_subprogram_declaration},
access-to-subprogram @nt{type_declaration}),
anything that has a @nt{discriminant_part}
(that is, various kinds of @nt{type_declaration}),
anything that has a @nt{component_list}
(that is, record @nt{type_declaration} and
record extension @nt{type_declaration}),
and finally the declarations of task and protected units and packages.
@end{Discussion}
@end{Notes}

@begin{DiffWord83}
@leading@;It was necessary to extend Ada 83's definition of declarative region
to take the following Ada 95 features into account:
@begin{Itemize}
Child library units.

Derived types/type extensions @em we need a declarative region for
inherited components and also for new components.

All the kinds of types that allow discriminants.

Protected units.

Entries that have bodies instead of accept statements.

The @nt{choice_parameter_specification} of an @nt{exception_handler}.

The formal parameters of access-to-subprogram types.

Renamings-as-body.
@end{Itemize}

Discriminated and access-to-subprogram type declarations
need a declarative region.
Enumeration type declarations cannot have one,
because you don't have to say "Color.Red" to refer to the literal Red
of Color.
For other type declarations,
it doesn't really matter whether or not there is an
associated declarative region,
so for simplicity, we give one to all types except enumeration types.

We now say that an @nt{accept_statement} has its own declarative
region, rather than being part of the declarative region of the
@nt{entry_declaration},
so that declarative regions are properly nested regions of text,
so that it makes sense to talk about "inner declarative regions,"
and "...extends to the end of a declarative region."
Inside an @nt{accept_statement}, the @nt{name} of one of the parameters
denotes the @nt{parameter_specification} of the @nt{accept_statement},
not that of the @nt{entry_declaration}. If the @nt{accept_statement} is
nested within a @nt{block_statement}, these
@nt{parameter_specification}s can hide declarations of the
@nt{block_statement}.
The semantics of such cases was unclear in RM83.
@begin{Honest}
  Unfortunately, we have the same problem for the entry name
  itself @em it should denote the @nt{accept_statement},
  but @nt{accept_statement}s are not declarations.
  They should be, and they should hide the entry from all visibility
  within themselves.
@end{Honest}

Note that we can't generalize this to @ntf{entry_bodies},
or other bodies, because the @nt{declarative_part} of a
body is not supposed to contain (explicit) homographs of
things in the declaration.
It works for @nt{accept_statement}s only because an
@nt{accept_statement} does not have a @nt{declarative_part}.

To avoid confusion,
we use the term @lquotes@;local to@rquotes@; only informally in Ada 95.
Even RM83 used the term incorrectly (see, for example, RM83-12.3(13)).

In Ada 83, (root) library units were inside Standard;
it was not clear whether the declaration or body of Standard
was meant.
In Ada 95, they are children of Standard,
and so occur immediately within Standard's declarative
region, but not within either the declaration or the body.
(See RM83-8.6(2) and RM83-10.1.1(5).)

@LabeledClause{Scope of Declarations}

@begin{Intro}
@redundant[For each declaration, the language rules define a certain
portion of the program text called the @i{scope} of the declaration.
The scope of a declaration is also called the scope of any view
or entity declared by the declaration.
Within the scope of an entity, and only there,
there are places where it is legal to refer
to the declared entity.
These places are defined by the rules of visibility and overloading.]
@end{Intro}

@begin{StaticSem}
@Leading@Defn2{Term=[immediate scope], Sec=(of a declaration)}
The @i{immediate scope} of a declaration
is a portion of the declarative region immediately enclosing
the declaration.
The immediate scope starts at the beginning of the declaration,
except in the case of an overloadable declaration,
in which case the immediate scope starts just after the place
where the profile of the callable entity is determined
(which is at the end of the @ntf<_specification> for the callable entity,
or at the end of the @nt<generic_instantiation> if an instance).
The immediate scope extends to the end of the declarative region,
with the following exceptions:
@begin{Reason}
The reason for making overloadable declarations with profiles
special is to simplify compilation:
until the compiler has determined the profile,
it doesn't know which other declarations are homographs of this one,
so it doesn't know which ones this one should hide.
Without this rule, two passes over the @ntf<_specification> or
@nt<generic_instantiation> would be required to
resolve names that denote things with the same name as this one.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Itemize}
The immediate scope of a @nt{library_item} includes only its semantic
dependents.
@begin{Reason}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]} 10 defines only a partial ordering of @nt{library_item}s.
Therefore, it is a good idea to restrict the immediate scope
(and the scope, defined below)
to semantic dependents.

@leading@;Consider also examples like this:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] P @key[is] @key[end] P;

@key[package] P.Q @key[is]
    I : Integer := 0;
@key[end] P.Q;

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{Presentation AI-00080 - syntax error}
@key[with] P;
@key[package] R @key[is]
    @key[package] X @key[renames] P;
    @Chg{New=[J : Integer := ],Old=[]}X.Q.I@Chg{New=[],Old=[ := 17]}; --@RI{ Illegal!}
@key[end] R;
@end{Example}

The scope of P.Q does not contain R.
Hence, neither P.Q nor X.Q are visible within R.
However, the name R.X.Q would be visible in some other
library unit where both R and P.Q are visible
(assuming R were made legal by removing the offending declaration).
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[AddedNormal],ARef=[AI95-00217-06]}
  @ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[This rule applies to limited views as well as
  @lquotes@;normal@rquotes library items. In that case, the semantic dependents
  are the units that have a @nt{limited_with_clause} for the limited view.]}
@end{Ramification}
The immediate scope of
a declaration in the private part of a library unit does
not include the visible part of any
public descendant of that library unit.
@Pdefn2{Term=[descendant],Sec=(relationship with scope)}
@begin{Ramification}
In other words, a declaration in the private part can be
visible within the visible part, private part and body of a private
child unit.
On the other hand, such a declaration
can be visible within only the private part and body of a public
child unit.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
The purpose of this rule is to prevent children from giving
private information to clients.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[AddedNormal],ARef=[AI95-00231-01]}
For a public child subprogram,
this means that the parent's private part is not visible in the
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[profile],Old=[@nt{formal_part}s]} of the declaration
and of the body.
This is true even for @ntf{subprogram_bodies} that are not
completions.
For a public child generic unit,
it means that the parent's private part is not visible in the
@nt{generic_formal_part}, as well as in
the first list of @nt{basic_declarative_item}s (for a generic package),
or the @Chg{Version=[2],New=[(syntactic) profile],Old=[@nt{formal_part}(s)]}
(for a generic subprogram).
@end{Ramification}
@end{Itemize}

@Defn{visible part}
@Redundant[The @i(visible part) of (a view of) an entity
is a portion of the text of its declaration
containing declarations that are visible from outside.]
@RootDefn{private part}
The @i{private part} of (a view of) an entity that has a visible part
contains all declarations within the declaration of
(the view of) the entity,
except those in the visible part;
@Redundant[these are not visible from outside.
Visible and private parts are defined only for these kinds of
entities: callable entities, other program units,
and composite types.]
@begin{Itemize}
@PDefn2{Term=[visible part], Sec=(of a view of a callable entity)}
The visible part of a view of a callable entity is its profile.

@PDefn2{Term=[visible part], Sec=(of a view of a composite type)}
The visible part of a composite type other than a task or protected type
consists of the declarations of
all components declared @Redundant[(explicitly or implicitly)]
within the @nt{type_declaration}.

@PDefn2{Term=[visible part], Sec=(of a generic unit)}
The visible part of a generic unit
includes the @nt{generic_formal_part}.
For a generic package, it also includes
the first list of @nt{basic_declarative_item}s of the
@nt{package_specification}.
For a generic subprogram, it also includes
the profile.
@begin{Reason}
Although there is no way to reference anything but the formals from
outside a generic unit, they are still in the visible part in the sense that
the corresponding declarations in an instance can be referenced
(at least in some cases).
In other words, these declarations have an effect on the outside world.
The visible part of a generic unit needs to be defined
this way in order to properly support
the rule that makes a parent's private part invisible within a
public child's visible part.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
The visible part of an instance of a generic unit is as defined
for packages and subprograms;
it is not defined in terms of the visible part of a generic unit.
@end{Ramification}

@Redundant[The visible part of a package, task unit, or protected
unit consists of declarations in the program unit's declaration
other than those following the reserved word @key{private}, if any;
see @RefSecNum{Package Specifications and Declarations}
and @RefSecNum{Formal Packages} for packages,
@RefSecNum{Task Units and Task Objects} for task units,
and @RefSecNum{Protected Units and Protected Objects}
for protected units.]
@end{Itemize}

@Defn2{Term=[scope], Sec=(of a declaration)}
The scope of a declaration always
contains the immediate scope of the declaration.
In addition, for a given declaration that occurs immediately within
the visible part of an outer declaration,
or is a public child of an outer declaration,
the scope of the given declaration
extends to the end of the scope of the outer declaration,
except that the scope of a @nt{library_item} includes only its
semantic dependents.
@begin{Ramification}
Note the recursion.
If a declaration appears in the visible part of a library unit,
its scope extends to the end of the scope of the library unit,
but since that only includes dependents of the declaration of the library unit,
the scope of the inner declaration also only includes those dependents.
If X renames library package P,
which has a child Q, a @nt{with_clause} mentioning P.Q is necessary to
be able to refer to X.Q,
even if P.Q is visible at the place where X is declared.

@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[@Defn2{Term=[scope], Sec=(of an attribute_@!definition_@!clause)}

The immediate scope of a declaration is also the immediate scope
of the entity or view declared by the declaration.
@Defn2{Term=[scope], Sec=[of (a view of) an entity]}
Similarly,
the scope of a declaration is also the scope
of the entity or view declared by the declaration.
@begin{Ramification}
@leading@;The rule for immediate scope implies the following:
@begin{Itemize}
If the declaration is that of a library unit,
then the immediate scope includes the declarative region of the
declaration itself, but not other places,
unless they are within the scope of a @nt{with_clause} that mentions the
library unit.

@NoPrefix@;It is necessary to attach the semantics of @nt{with_clause}s to
[immediate] scopes (as opposed to visibility),
in order for various rules to work properly.
A library unit should hide a homographic implicit declaration that
appears in its parent, but only within the scope of a @nt{with_clause}
that mentions the library unit.
Otherwise, we would violate the "legality determinable via semantic
dependences" rule of @RefSec{Program Structure and Compilation Issues}.
The declaration of a library unit should be allowed to be a homograph of
an explicit declaration in its parent's body,
so long as that body does not mention the library unit in a
@nt{with_clause}.

@NoPrefix@;This means that one cannot denote the declaration of the library unit,
but one might still be able to denote the library unit via another
view.

@NoPrefix@;A @nt{with_clause} does not make the declaration of a library unit
visible; the lack of a @nt{with_clause} prevents it from being visible.
Even if a library unit is mentioned in a @nt{with_clause},
its declaration can still be hidden.

The completion of the declaration of a library unit
(assuming that's also a declaration)
is not visible, neither directly nor by selection,
outside that completion.

The immediate scope of
a declaration immediately within the body of a library unit
does not include any child of that library unit.

@NoPrefix@;This is needed to prevent children from looking inside their
parent's body. The children are in the declarative region of the
parent, and they might be after the parent's body.
Therefore, the scope of a declaration that occurs immediately within
the body might include some children.

There are notations for denoting visible declarations

@nt{subprogram_@!declaration} so that they can be used in
named-notation calls appearing outside the called subprogram.

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The fact that the immediate scope of an overloadable declaration does
not include its profile is new to Ada 95. It replaces
RM83-8.3(16), which said that within
a subprogram specification and within the formal part of an
entry declaration or accept statement, all declarations with
the same designator as the subprogram or entry were hidden from all
visibility.
The RM83-8.3(16) rule seemed to be overkill, and created both
implementation difficulties and unnecessary semantic complexity.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
We no longer need to talk about the scope of notations,
@nt{identifier}s, @nt{character_literal}s, and @nt{operator_symbol}s.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
The notion of "visible part" has been extended in Ada 95.
The syntax of
task and protected units now allows private parts,
thus requiring us to be able to talk about the visible part as well.
It was necessary to extend the concept to subprograms
and to generic units, in order for the visibility rules
related to child library units to work properly.
It was necessary to define the concept separately for
generic formal packages, since their visible part is
slightly different from that of a normal package.
Extending the concept to composite types made the
definition of scope slightly simpler.
We define visible part for some things elsewhere,
since it makes a big difference to the user for those things.
For composite types and subprograms, however,
the concept is used only in arcane visibility rules,
so we localize it to this @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}.

In Ada 83, the semantics of @nt{with_clause}s was described

@LabeledClause{Visibility}

@begin{Intro}
@redundant[@Defn{visibility rules}
The @i{visibility rules},
given below, determine which declarations are
visible and directly visible at each place within a program.
The visibility rules apply to both explicit and implicit declarations.]
@end{Intro}

@begin{StaticSem}
@Defn2{Term=[visibility], Sec=(direct)}
@Defn{directly visible}
@Defn{directly visible}
A declaration is defined to be @i{directly visible} at places
where a @nt<name> consisting of only an @nt{identifier} or
@nt{operator_symbol} is sufficient to denote the declaration;
that is, no @nt<selected_component> notation or special context
(such as preceding => in a named association) is necessary
to denote the declaration.
@Defn{visible}
A declaration is defined to be @i{visible} wherever it is
directly visible, as well as at other places where
some @nt<name> (such as a @nt<selected_component>) can denote
the declaration.

The syntactic category @nt<direct_name> is used to indicate
contexts where direct visibility is required.
The syntactic category @nt<selector_name> is used to indicate
contexts where visibility, but not direct visibility,
is required.

@Defn2{Term=[visibility], Sec=(immediate)}
@Defn2{Term=[visibility], Sec=(use clause)}
There are two kinds of direct visibility:
@i{immediate visibility} and @i{use-visibility}.
@Defn{immediately visible}
A declaration is immediately visible at a place if it is directly
visible because the place is within its immediate scope.
@Defn{use-visible}
A declaration is use-visible if it is directly visible
because of a @nt{use_clause} (see @RefSecNum{Use Clauses}).
Both conditions can apply.

@Defn{hiding}
A declaration can be @i{hidden}, either from direct visibility,
or from all visibility,
within certain parts of its scope.
@Defn{hidden from all visibility}
Where @i{hidden from all visibility},
it is not visible at all (neither using a @nt<direct_name>
nor a @nt<selector_name>).
@Defn{hidden from direct visibility}
Where @i{hidden from direct visibility}, only direct visibility is lost;
visibility using a @nt<selector_name> is still possible.

@redundant[@Defn{overloaded}
Two or more declarations are @i{overloaded} if
they all have the same defining name
and there is a place where they are all directly visible.]
@begin{Ramification}
Note that a @nt{name} can have more than one possible interpretation
even if it denotes a nonoverloadable entity.
For example, if there are two functions F that return records,
both containing a component called C, then
the name F.C has two possible interpretations,
even though component declarations are not overloadable.
@end{Ramification}

@Defn{overloadable}
The declarations of callable entities
@Redundant[(including enumeration literals)]
are @i{overloadable}@Redundant[,
meaning that overloading is allowed for them].
@begin{Ramification}
A @nt{generic_declaration} is not overloadable within its own
@nt{generic_formal_part}.
This follows from the rules about when a @nt{name} denotes a current
instance.
See AI83-00286. This implies that within a
@nt{generic_formal_part}, outer declarations with the same defining name
are hidden from direct visibility. It also implies that if a generic
formal parameter has the same defining name as the generic itself,
the formal parameter hides the generic from direct visibility.
@end{Ramification}

@Defn{homograph}
Two declarations are @i{homographs}
if they have the same defining name,
and, if both are overloadable,
their profiles are type conformant.
@PDefn{type conformance}
@redundant[An inner declaration hides any outer homograph from direct visibility.]

@leading@Redundant[Two homographs are not generally allowed

@i{overrides} the other (see Legality Rules below).]
@Defn{override}
@Chg{New=[The only declarations that are @Defn{overridable}@i{overridable} are
the implicit declarations for predefined operators and inherited primitive
subprograms.],Old=[]}
A declaration overrides another homograph that occurs
immediately within the same declarative region in the
following cases:
@begin{Itemize}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0025],ARef=[AI95-00044-01]}
@Chg{New=[A declaration that is not overridable overrides one that is overridable],

@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0025],ARef=[AI95-00044-01]}
And regardless of whether the @Chg{New=[nonoverridable],Old=[explicit]}
declaration is overloadable or not.
@Chg{New=[For example, @nt{statement_identifier}s are covered by this rule.],Old=[]}

The @lquotes@;regardless of which declaration occurs first@rquotes@;
is there because the explicit declaration could be a primitive subprogram
of a partial view, and then the full view might inherit a homograph.
We are saying that the explicit one wins
(within its scope), even though the implicit one comes later.

If the overriding declaration is also a subprogram,
then it is a primitive subprogram.

As explained in @RefSec{Private Operations},
some inherited primitive subprograms are never declared.
Such subprograms cannot be overridden,
although they can be reached by dispatching calls
in the case of a tagged type.
@end{Ramification}

The implicit declaration of an inherited operator overrides
that of a predefined operator;
@begin{Ramification}
In a previous version of Ada 9X, we tried to avoid the notion of
predefined operators, and say that they were inherited from some
magical root type.
However, this seemed like too much mechanism.
Therefore, a type can have a predefined "+" as well as an inherited "+".
The above rule says the inherited one wins.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
The @lquotes@;regardless of which declaration occurs first@rquotes@; applies here
as well, in the case where @Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt{derived_type_definition}],
Old=[@ntf{derived_type_declaration}]} in the visible
part of a public library unit derives from a private type declared in
the parent unit, and the full view of the parent type has additional
predefined operators, as explained in @RefSec{Private Operations}.
Those predefined operators can be overridden by inherited subprograms
implicitly declared earlier.
@end{Ramification}

An implicit declaration of an inherited subprogram
overrides a previous implicit declaration of an inherited
subprogram.

@leading@;Normally, these rules just mean you can't explicitly
declare two homographs
immediately within the same declarative region.
The wording is designed to handle the
following special cases:
@begin{Itemize}
If the second declaration completes the first one,
the second declaration is legal.

@leading@;If the body of a library unit contains an explicit homograph of
a child of that same library unit, this is illegal only if the body
mentions the child in its @nt<context_clause>, or if
some subunit mentions the child.
Here's an example:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] P @key[is]
@key[end] P;

@key[package] P.Q @key[is]
@key[end] P.Q;

@key[package] @key[body] P @key[is]

@key[separate](P)
@key[procedure] Sub @key[is] --@RI{ Illegal.}
@key[begin]
    @key[null];

@NoPrefix@;If package body P said "@key[with] P.Q;", then it would be illegal

However, the subunit would be able to see both P.Q's,
and is therefore illegal.

@NoPrefix@;A previous version of Ada 9X allowed the subunit,

the component I of the parent type is never visible. The parent component

fact that the A.T.I component was never declared for type D.NT3. Thus, A.E.NT4
does not (visibly) inherit the component I from A.T, while it does inherit the
component I from D.NT3. Of course, both components exist, and can be accessed
by a type conversion as shown above. This behavior stems from the fact that
every characteristic of a type (including components) must be declared
somewhere in the innermost declarative region containing the type @em if the
characteristic is never visible in that declarative region, it is never
declared. Therefore, such characteristics do not suddenly become available even

@end{Itemize}

Note that we need to be careful which things we make "hidden from all
visibility" versus which things we make simply illegal for names to
denote. The distinction is subtle.
The rules that disallow names denoting components within a type
declaration (see @RefSecNum{Discriminants}) do not make the components
invisible at those places, so that the above rule makes components with
the same name illegal.
The same is true for the rule that disallows names denoting formal
parameters within a @nt{formal_part} (see @RefSecNum{Subprogram Declarations}).
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Discussion}
The part about instances is from AI83-00012.
The reason it says @lquotes@;overloadable declarations@rquotes@; is because
we don't want it to apply to type extensions that appear in an instance;
components are not overloadable.
@end{Discussion}
@end{Legality}

@begin{Notes}
Visibility for compilation units
follows from the definition of the environment
in @RefSecNum{The Compilation Process},
except that it is necessary to apply a @nt{with_clause} to obtain
visibility to a @nt{library_unit_declaration}
or @nt{library_unit_renaming_declaration}.

In addition to the visibility rules given above,
the meaning of the occurrence of a @nt{direct_name} or
@nt{selector_name} at a given place in the text can depend on
the overloading rules
(see @RefSecNum{The Context of Overload Resolution}).

Not all contexts where an @nt<identifier>, @nt<character_literal>,
or @nt<operator_symbol> are allowed require visibility of a corresponding
declaration.
Contexts where visibility is not required
are identified by using one of these three syntactic categories
directly in a syntax rule, rather than using @nt<direct_name> or
@nt<selector_name>.
@begin{Ramification}
@leading@;An @nt{identifier}, @nt{character_literal} or @nt{operator_symbol}
that occurs in one of the following contexts is not
required to denote a visible or directly
visible declaration:
@begin{enumerate}
A defining name.

The @nt{identifier}s or @nt{operator_symbol} that appear after the
reserved word @key{end} in a @nt{proper_body}.
Similarly for @lquotes@;@key{end loop}@rquotes@;, etc.

An @nt{attribute_designator}.

A @nt{pragma} @nt{identifier}.

A @SynI{pragma_argument_}@nt{identifier}.

An @nt{identifier} specific to a
pragma used in a pragma argument.

@ChgAdded{Version=[3],Text=[An @nt{identifier} specific to an aspect used
in an @nt{aspect_definition}.]}
@end{enumerate}

The visibility rules have nothing to do with the above cases;
the meanings of such things are defined elsewhere.
Reserved words are not @nt{identifier}s;
the visibility rules don't apply to them either.

Because of the way we have defined "declaration",
it is possible for a usage name to denote a @nt{subprogram_body}, either
within that body, or (for a nonlibrary unit) after it
(since the body hides the corresponding declaration, if any).
Other bodies do not work that way.
Completions of @nt{type_declaration}s and
deferred constant declarations do work that way.
@nt{Accept_statement}s are never denoted, although the
@nt{parameter_specification}s in their profiles can be.

@leading@;The scope of a subprogram does not start until after its profile.
Thus, the following is legal:
@begin{Example}
X : @key[constant] Integer := 17;
...
@key[package] P @key[is]
    @key[procedure] X(Y : @key[in] Integer := X);
@key[end] P;
@end{Example}

The body of the subprogram will probably be illegal,
however, since the constant X will be hidden by then.

@leading@;The rule is different for generic subprograms,
since they are not overloadable;
the following is illegal:
@begin{Example}
X : @key[constant] Integer := 17;
@key[package] P @key[is]
    @key[generic]
      Z : Integer := X; --@RI{ Illegal!}
    @key[procedure] X(Y : @key[in] Integer := X); --@RI{ Illegal!}
@key[end] P;
@end{Example}

The constant X is hidden from direct visibility by the generic
declaration.
@end{Ramification}
@end{Notes}

@begin{Extend83}

a @nt{use_clause} for the appropriate package.

@Defn{Beaujolais effect}
The rules for @nt{use_clause}s were carefully constructed to avoid
so-called @i(Beaujolais) effects, where the addition or removal

@Defn2{Term=[scope], Sec=(of a @nt{use_clause})}
For each @nt{use_clause},
there is a certain region of text called the @i{scope} of the @nt{use_clause}.
For a @nt{use_clause} within a @nt{context_clause} of a
@nt{library_unit_declaration}
or @nt{library_unit_renaming_declaration},
the scope is the entire declarative region of the declaration.
For a @nt{use_clause} within a @nt{context_clause} of a
body, the scope is the entire body @Redundant[and any
subunits (including multiply
nested subunits).
The scope does not include @nt<context_clause>s themselves.]

For a @nt{use_clause} immediately within a declarative region,
the scope is the portion of the declarative region
starting just after the @nt{use_clause}
and extending to the end of the declarative region.
However, the scope of a @nt{use_clause} in the private part of a library

any public descendant of that library unit.
@begin{Reason}

  A @nt{use_type_clause} @Chg{Version=[3],New=[without @key[all] ],Old=[]}is only for operators.

  The semantics described here should be similar
  to the semantics for expanded names given
  in @RefSec{Selected Components}
  so as to achieve the effect requested by
  the @lquotes@;principle of equivalence of @nt{use_clause}s and
  @nt{selected_component}s.@rquotes@;
  Thus, child library units and generic formal parameters of a formal
  package are
  potentially use-visible when their enclosing package is use'd.

  The "visible at that place" part implies that
  applying a @nt{use_clause} to a parent unit does not make all of its
  children use-visible @em only those that have been made
  visible by a @nt{with_clause}.
  It also implies that we don't have to worry about hiding in the
  definition of "directly visible" @em a declaration cannot be use-visible
  unless it is visible.

  Note that
  "@key[use type] T'Class;" is equivalent to "@key[use type] T;",
  which helps avoid breaking the generic contract model.

@leading@Defn{use-visible}
@Defn2{Term=[visibility],Sec=(use clause)}
A declaration is @i{use-visible} if it is potentially use-visible,
except in these naming-conflict cases:
@begin{itemize}
  A potentially use-visible declaration is not use-visible if the place
  considered is within the immediate scope of a homograph of the
  declaration.

  Potentially use-visible declarations that have the same @nt{identifier}
  are not use-visible unless each of them is an overloadable
  declaration.
@begin{Ramification}
  Overloadable declarations don't cancel each other out,
  even if they are homographs,
  though if they are not distinguishable
  by formal parameter names or the presence or absence of
  @nt{default_expression}s, any use will be ambiguous.
  We only mention @nt{identifier}s here, because
  declarations named by @nt<operator_symbol>s are
  always overloadable, and hence never cancel each other.
  Direct visibility is irrelevant for @nt{character_literal}s.
@end{Ramification}
@end{itemize}
@end{StaticSem}

@begin{RunTime}
@PDefn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(use_clause)}
The elaboration of a @nt{use_clause} has no effect.
@end{RunTime}

@begin{Examples}

@end{WideAbove}
@begin{Example}
@key[use type] Rational_Numbers.Rational; --@RI{ see @RefSecNum{Package Specifications and Declarations}}
Two_Thirds: Rational_Numbers.Rational := 2/3;
@end{Example}

@begin{Ramification}
In @lquotes@;@key[use] X, Y;@rquotes@;, Y cannot refer to something made visible by the
@lquotes@;@key[use]@rquotes@; of X.
Thus, it's not (quite) equivalent to @lquotes@;@key[use] X; @key[use] Y;@rquotes@;.

If a given declaration is already immediately visible,
then a @nt{use_clause} that makes it potentially use-visible
has no effect.
Therefore,
a @nt{use_type_clause} for a type whose declaration appears
in a place other than the visible part
of a package has no effect;
it cannot make a declaration use-visible
unless that declaration is already immediately visible.

"@key[Use] @key[type] S1;" and "@key[use] @key[type] S2;"
are equivalent if S1 and S2 are both subtypes of the same type.
In particular,
"@key[use] @key[type] S;" and "@key[use] @key[type] S'Base;"
are equivalent.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
We considered adding a rule that prevented several declarations of
views of the same entity that all have the same semantics from
cancelling each other out.
For example, if a (possibly implicit)
@nt{subprogram_declaration} for "+" is potentially use-visible,
and a fully conformant renaming of it is also potentially
use-visible, then they (annoyingly) cancel each other out;
neither one is use-visible.
The considered rule would have made just one of them use-visible.
We gave up on this idea due to the complexity of the rule.
It would have had to account for both overloadable and
nonoverloadable @nt{renaming_declaration}s,
the case where the rule should apply only to some subset of the
declarations with the same defining name,
and the case of @nt{subtype_declaration}s
(since they are claimed to be sufficient for renaming of subtypes).

@end{RunTime}

@begin{Notes}
Renaming may be used to resolve name conflicts and to act as a
shorthand. Renaming with a different @nt{identifier} or
@nt{operator_symbol} does not hide the old @nt{name}; the new
@nt{name} and the old @nt{name} need not be visible at the same
places.

A task or protected object that is declared by an explicit
@nt{object_declaration} can be renamed as an object. However, a
single task or protected object cannot be renamed since the
corresponding type is anonymous (meaning it has no nameable subtypes).
For similar reasons, an object of an anonymous array or access type
cannot be renamed.

@leading@keepnext@;A subtype defined without any additional constraint
can be used to achieve the effect of renaming another subtype
(including a task or protected subtype) as in
@begin{Example}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The second sentence of RM83-8.5(3),
@lquotes@;At any point where a renaming declaration is visible,

which appears in RM83-8.5(4) (for objects) and RM83-8.5(7) (for subprograms) is

nothing to do with the renamed subprogram.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0123-1]}
Note that the above rule is only for tagged types@Chg{Version=[3],New=[ and
equality of untagged record types],Old=[]}.

@leading@keepnext@;Consider the following example:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] P @key[is]
    @key[type] T @key[is] @key[tagged] @key[null] @key[record];
    @key[function] Predefined_Equal(X, Y : T) @key[return] Boolean @key[renames] "=";

    @key[function] "="(X, Y : T) @key[return] Boolean; --@RI{ Override predefined "=".}
@key[end] P;

@key[with] P; @key[use] P;

    @key[function] User_Defined_Equal(X, Y : T) @key[return] Boolean @key[renames] P."=";
@key[end] Q;
@end{Example}

A call on Predefined_Equal will execute the predefined equality operator
of T, whereas a call on User_Defined_Equal will execute the body of the
overriding declaration in the private part of P.

Thus a renaming allows one to squirrel away a copy of an inherited or
predefined subprogram before later overriding it.@Defn{squirrel away}

@begin{Notes}
A procedure can only be renamed as a procedure.
A function whose @nt{defining_designator} is either an
@nt{identifier} or an @nt{operator_symbol}
can be renamed with either an
@nt{identifier} or an @nt{operator_symbol};
for renaming as an operator, the subprogram specification given in
the @nt{renaming_declaration} is subject to the rules given in
@RefSecNum{Overloading of Operators}
for operator declarations. Enumeration literals can be
renamed as functions; similarly, @nt{attribute_reference}s that
denote functions (such as references to Succ and Pred) can be renamed
as functions. An entry can only be renamed as a procedure; the new
@nt{name} is only allowed to appear in contexts that allow a
procedure @nt{name}. An entry of a family can be renamed, but an
entry family cannot be renamed as a whole.


The operators of the root numeric types cannot be renamed because the
types in the profile are anonymous, so the corresponding specifications
cannot be written; the same holds for certain attributes, such as Pos.

The primitiveness of a renaming-as-declaration is determined by its
profile, and by where it occurs, as for any declaration of
(a view of) a subprogram;
primitiveness is not determined by the renamed view.
In order to perform a dispatching call,
the subprogram name has to denote a primitive subprogram,
not a nonprimitive renaming of a primitive subprogram.
@begin{Reason}
A @nt{subprogram_renaming_declaration} could more properly be called
@ntf{renaming_@!as_@!subprogram_@!declaration}, since you're renaming something
as a subprogram, but you're not necessarily renaming a subprogram.
But that's too much of a mouthful. Or, alternatively, we could call it a
@ntf{callable_@!entity_@!renaming_@!declaration}, but that's even worse.
Not only is it a mouthful, it emphasizes the entity being renamed,
rather than the new view, which we think is a bad idea.
We'll live with the oddity.

@LabeledClause{The Context of Overload Resolution}

@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@redundant[@Defn{overload resolution}
Because declarations can be overloaded,
it is possible for an occurrence of a usage name
to have more than one possible interpretation;
in most cases, ambiguity is disallowed.
This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]} describes
how the possible interpretations resolve
to the actual interpretation.

@Defn{overloading rules}
Certain rules of the language (the @ResolutionTitle)
are considered @lquotes@;overloading rules@rquotes@;.
If a possible interpretation violates an overloading rule,
it is assumed not to be the intended interpretation;
some other possible interpretation
is assumed to be the actual interpretation.
On the other hand,
violations of nonoverloading rules do not affect which
interpretation is chosen; instead,
they cause the construct to be illegal.
To be legal, there usually has to be exactly one acceptable
interpretation of a construct that is a @lquotes@;complete context@rquotes@;,
not counting any nested complete contexts.

@Defn2{Term=[grammar],Sec=(resolution of ambiguity)}
The syntax rules of the language and the visibility rules
given in @RefSecNum{Visibility}
determine the possible interpretations.
Most type checking rules
(rules that require a particular type,
or a particular class of types,
for example)
are overloading rules.
Various rules for the matching of formal and actual parameters are
overloading rules.]
@end{Intro}

@begin{MetaRules}
The type resolution rules are
intended to minimize the need for implicit declarations
and preference rules associated with implicit conversion and dispatching
operations.

A @nt{declarative_item} or declaration.
@begin{Ramification}
A @nt{loop_parameter_specification} is a declaration,

A @nt{statement}.

A @nt{pragma_argument_association}.

(and, therefore, which view and which entity it denotes); and
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00382-01]}
In most cases, a usage name denotes the view declared by the denoted
declaration.
However, in certain cases, a usage name that denotes a declaration and
appears inside the declarative region of that same declaration, denotes
the current instance of the declaration.
For example, within a @nt{task_body}@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ other than in
an @nt{access_definition}],Old=[]}, a usage name that denotes the
@nt{task_type_declaration} denotes the object containing the
currently executing task,

A possible interpretation (an @i{input} to overload

@end{Ramification}

@Defn2{Term=[preference], Sec=(for root numeric operators and @nt<range>s)}
There is a @i{preference} for the primitive operators (and @nt<range>s)
of the root numeric
types @i{root_integer} and @i{root_real}.
In particular,
if two acceptable interpretations of a constituent of a complete
context differ only in that one is for a primitive operator (or
@nt<range>) of the
type @i{root_integer} or @i{root_real}, and the other is not,
the interpretation using the primitive operator (or @nt<range>)
of the root numeric type is @i{preferred}.

@begin{Reason}
@leading@;The reason for this preference is so that expressions involving
literals and named numbers can be unambiguous.
For example, without the preference rule, the following would be ambiguous:
@begin{Example}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{Presentation AI-00022}
N : @key[constant] := 123;
@key[if] N > 100 @key[then] --@RI{ Preference for root_integer "@Chg{New=[>],Old=[<]}" operator.}

@key[end] @key[if];
@end{Example}
@end{Reason}

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI05-0149-1]}
@ChgAdded{Version=[3],Text=[Similarly,
there is a preference for the equality operators of the @i{universal_access}
type (see @RefSecNum{Relational Operators and Membership Tests}). If two

@i{universal_access} type, and the other is not, the interpretation using the

preferred.@Defn2{Term=[preference], Sec=(for universal access equality operators)}]}

@begin{Reason}
  @ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[AddedNormal]}

@end{Reason}

For a complete context, if there is exactly one
overall acceptable interpretation where each constituent's interpretation
is the same as or preferred (in the
above sense) over those in all other overall acceptable interpretations, then
that one overall acceptable interpretation is chosen.
@Defn{ambiguous}
Otherwise, the complete context is @i{ambiguous}.

A complete context other than a @nt{pragma_argument_association}
shall not be ambiguous.

A complete context that is a @nt{pragma_argument_association}
is allowed to be ambiguous (unless otherwise specified
for the particular pragma),
but only
if every acceptable interpretation of the pragma argument is as a
@nt{name} that statically denotes a callable entity.
@PDefn2{Term=[denote],Sec=(name used as a pragma argument)}
Such a @nt{name} denotes
all of the declarations determined by its interpretations,
and all of the views declared by these declarations.
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00224-01]}@ChgNote{Pragma is obsolete}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
This applies to Inline, Suppress,
Import, Export, and Convention @nt{pragma}s.
For example, it is OK to say @lquotes@;@key[pragma] @Chg{Version=[2],
New=[Export(C, Entity_Name],Old=[Suppress(Elaboration_Check, On]}
=> P.Q);@rquotes@;, even if there are two directly visible P's, and
there are two Q's declared in the visible part of each P.
In this case, P.Q denotes four different declarations.
This rule also applies to certain pragmas defined in the
Specialized Needs Annexes.
It almost applies to Pure, Elaborate_Body, and Elaborate_All @nt{pragma}s,
but those can't have overloading for other reasons.
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[ Note that almost all of
these pragmas are obsolescent (see @RefSecNum{Specific Suppression of Checks} and
@RefSecNum{Aspect-related Pragmas}), and a major reason is that this rule
has proven to be too broad in practice (it is common to want to specify something
on a single subprogram of an overloaded set, that can't be done easily with this
rule). @nt{Aspect_specification}s,
which are given on individual declarations, are preferred in Ada 2012.],Old=[]}

Note that if a pragma argument denotes a @i{call} to a callable
entity, rather than the entity itself,
this exception does not apply, and ambiguity is disallowed.

Note that we need to carefully define which pragma-related rules are
@ResolutionName@;s,
so that, for example, a @nt{pragma} Inline does not pick up
subprograms declared in enclosing declarative regions,
and therefore make itself illegal.

We say @lquotes@;statically denotes@rquotes@; in the above rule in order to avoid
having to worry about how many times the @nt{name} is evaluated,
in case it denotes more than one callable entity.
@end{Ramification}
@end{Legality}

@begin{Notes}
If a usage name has only one acceptable interpretation,
then it denotes the corresponding entity.
However, this does not mean that the usage name is necessarily legal
since other requirements exist which are not considered for overload
resolution; for example, the fact that an expression is static, whether
an object is constant, mode and subtype conformance rules, freezing
rules, order of elaboration, and so on.

@NoPrefix@;Similarly, subtypes are not considered for overload resolution (the
violation of a constraint does not make a program illegal but raises an
exception during program execution).

@PDefn{Beaujolais effect}

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The rule that allows an expected type to match an actual expression of a

@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
In Ada 83, it is not clear what the @lquotes@;syntax rules@rquotes@; are.
AI83-00157 states that a certain textual rule is a syntax rule,
but it's still not clear how one tells in general which textual rules are
syntax rules.
We have solved the problem by stating exactly which
rules are syntax rules @em the ones that appear under the @lquotes@;@SyntaxTitle@rquotes@;
heading.

RM83 has a long list of the @lquotes@;forms@rquotes@; of rules that are to be
used in overload resolution (in addition to the syntax rules).
It is not clear exactly which rules fall under each form.
We have solved the problem by explicitly
marking all rules that are used in overload resolution.
Thus, the list of kinds of rules is unnecessary.
It is replaced with some introductory
(intentionally vague)
text explaining the basic idea
of what sorts of rules are overloading rules.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
It is not clear from RM83 what information is embodied in a @lquotes@;meaning@rquotes@;
or an @lquotes@;interpretation.@rquotes@;
@lquotes@;Meaning@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;interpretation@rquotes@; were intended to be synonymous;
we now use the latter only in defining the rules about overload
resolution.
@lquotes@;Meaning@rquotes@; is used only informally.
This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]} attempts to clarify what
is meant by @lquotes@;interpretation.@rquotes@;

@NoPrefix@;For example,
RM83 does not make it clear that overload resolution is required in
order to match @ntf{subprogram_bodies} with their corresponding
declarations (and even to tell whether a given @nt{subprogram_body}
is the completion of a previous declaration).
Clearly, the information needed to do this is part of the
@lquotes@;interpretation@rquotes@; of a @nt{subprogram_body}.
The resolution of such things is defined in terms of
the @lquotes@;expected profile@rquotes@; concept.
Ada 95 has some new cases where expected profiles
are needed @em the resolution of P'Access,
where P might denote a subprogram,
is an example.

@Leading@NoPrefix@;RM83-8.7(2) might seem to imply that an interpretation
embodies information about what is denoted by each usage name,
but not information about which syntactic category each construct belongs to.
However, it seems necessary to include such information,
since the Ada grammar is highly ambiguous.
For example, X(Y) might be a @nt{function_call} or an
@nt{indexed_component}, and no context-free/syntactic information can
tell the difference.
It seems like we should view X(Y) as being, for example, @lquotes@;interpreted as a
@nt{function_call}@rquotes@; (if that's what overload resolution decides it is).
Note that there are examples where the denotation of each usage name
does not imply the syntactic category.
However, even if that were not true, it seems that intuitively,
the interpretation includes that information.
Here's an example:
@begin{Example}
@key[type] T;
@key[type] A @key[is] @key[access] T;
@key[type] T @key[is] @key[array](Integer @key[range] 1..10) @key[of] A;
I : Integer := 3;
@key[function] F(X : Integer := 7) @key[return] A;
Y : A := F(I); --@RI{ Ambiguous? (We hope so.)}
@end{Example}

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{To be consistent with 8652/0006}
@NoPrefix@;Consider the declaration of Y (a complete context).
In the above example, overload resolution can easily determine the
declaration, and therefore the entity,
denoted by Y, A, F, and I.
However, given all of that information,
we still don't know whether F(I) is a @nt{function_call}
or an @nt{indexed_component} whose @Chg{New=[@nt{prefix}],Old=[prefix]} is
a @nt{function_call}.
(In the latter case, it is equivalent to F(7).@key[all](I).)

@NoPrefix@;It seems clear that the declaration of Y ought to be considered
ambiguous.
We describe that by saying that there are two interpretations,
one as a @nt{function_call}, and one as an @nt{indexed_component}.
These interpretations are both acceptable to the overloading
rules.
Therefore, the complete context is ambiguous, and therefore illegal.

@PDefn{Beaujolais effect}
It is the intent that the Ada 95 preference rule for root numeric
operators is more locally enforceable than that of RM83-4.6(15).
It should also eliminate interpretation shifts due to the
addition or removal of a @nt{use_clause}
(the so called @i{Beaujolais} effect).

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
RM83-8.7 seems to be missing some complete contexts,
such as @nt{pragma_argument_association}s,
@nt{declarative_item}s that are not
declarations or @Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt{aspect_clause}s],
Old=[@nt{representation_clause}s]},
and @nt{context_item}s.
We have added these, and also replaced the @lquotes@;must be determinable@rquotes@;
wording of RM83-5.4(3) with the notion that the expression of a
@nt{case_statement} is a complete context.

Cases like the Val attribute are now handled using the normal type
resolution rules, instead of having special cases that explicitly allow
things like @lquotes@;any integer type.@rquotes@;
