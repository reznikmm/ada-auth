@Defn2{Term=[library],Sec=(informal introduction)}
As explained below,
a partition is constructed from @i{library units}.
Syntactically, the declaration of a library unit is a @nt{library_item},
as is the body of a library unit.
An implementation may support a concept of a @i{program library}
(or simply, a @lquotes@;library@rquotes@;),
which contains @nt{library_item}s
and their subunits.
@IndexSee{Term=[program library],See=(library)}
Library units may be organized into a hierarchy of
children, grandchildren, and so on.]

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[clause],Old=[section]} has two
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclauses],Old=[clauses]}:
@RefSec{Separate Compilation}
discusses compile-time issues related to separate compilation.
@RefSec{Program Execution}
discusses issues related to what is traditionally known as @lquotes@;link time@rquotes@;
and @lquotes@;run time@rquotes@; @em building and executing partitions.

@end{Intro}

@begin{MetaRules}
@Defn{avoid overspecifying environmental issues}
We should avoid specifying details that are outside the domain of the
language itself.
The standard is intended (at least in part)
to promote portability of Ada programs at the source level.
It is not intended to standardize extra-language issues such as how one
invokes the compiler (or other tools),
how one's source is represented and organized,
version management, the format of error messages, etc.

@Defn{safe separate compilation}
@Defn2{Term=[separate compilation], Sec=(safe)}
The rules of the language should be enforced
even in the presence of separate compilation.
Using separate compilation should not make a
program less safe.

@Defn{legality determinable via semantic dependences}
It should be possible to determine the legality of a
compilation unit by looking only at the compilation unit itself
and the compilation units upon which it depends semantically.
As an example, it should be possible to analyze the legality of
two compilation units in parallel if they do not depend semantically
upon each other.

On the other hand, it may be necessary to look outside that set in
order to generate code @em this is generally true for
generic instantiation and inlining, for example.
Also on the other hand,
it is generally necessary to look outside that set in
order to check @LinkTimeName@;s.

@RefSec{Generic Instantiation}.

@ImplDef{The representation for a @nt{compilation}.}
@begin{Ramification}
Some implementations might choose to make a
@nt{compilation} be a source (text) file.
Others might allow multiple source files to be automatically
concatenated to form a single @nt{compilation}.
Others still may represent the source in a nontextual form such as a parse
tree.
Note that the RM95 does not even define the concept of a
source file.

Note that a protected subprogram is a subprogram,
and therefore a program unit.
An instance of a generic unit is a program unit.

A protected entry is a program unit,
but protected entries cannot be separately compiled.

@begin{Discussion}
For example, an implementation might disallow a @nt{compilation} that

contains the declarations for library packages P1 and P2,
where P1 precedes P2 in the @nt<compilation> but P1 has a
@nt<with_clause> that mentions P2.
@end{Discussion}
@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The interactions between language issues and environmental issues
are left open in Ada 95. The environment concept is new.
In Ada 83, the concept of the program library, for example,
appeared to be quite concrete,
although the rules had no force,
since implementations could get around them simply by defining various
mappings from the concept of an Ada program library to whatever data
structures were actually stored in support of separate compilation.
Indeed, implementations were encouraged to do so.

In RM83, it was unclear which was the official definition of
@lquotes@;program unit@rquotes@;.
Definitions appeared in RM83-5, 6, 7, and 9, but not 12.
Placing it here seems logical,
since a program unit is sort of a potential compilation unit.

@begin{Intro}
@Defn{library unit}
@PDefn{library}@Comment{There is a different definition of library in 10.1.4.}
@Seealso{Primary=[library],Other=[library level]}
@Seealso{Primary=[library],Other=[library unit]}
@Seealso{Primary=[library],Other=[library_item]}
A @i{library unit} is a program unit that is declared by a
@nt{library_item}.
When a program unit is a library unit,
the prefix @lquotes@;library@rquotes@; is used to refer to it (or @lquotes@;generic library@rquotes@;
if generic),
as well as to its declaration and body,
as in @lquotes@;library procedure@rquotes@;, @lquotes@;library @nt{package_body}@rquotes@;, or
@lquotes@;generic library package@rquotes@;.
@Defn{compilation unit}
The term @i{compilation unit} is used to refer to
a @nt{compilation_unit}.
When the meaning is clear from context,
the term is also used to refer to the @nt{library_item}
of a @nt{compilation_unit}
or to the @nt{proper_body} of a @nt{subunit}
@Redundant[(that is, the @nt{compilation_unit} without the
@nt{context_clause} and the @key[separate] (@nt{parent_unit_name}))].
@begin{Discussion}
@leading@keepnext@;In this example:
@begin{Example}
@key[with] Ada.Text_IO;
@key[package] P @key[is]
    ...
@key[end] P;
@end{Example}

the term @lquotes@;compilation unit@rquotes@; can refer to this text: @lquotes@;@key[with] Ada.Text_IO;
@key[package] P @key[is] ... @key[end] P;@rquotes@; or to this text:
@lquotes@;@key[package] P @key[is] ... @key[end] P;@rquotes@;. We use this shorthand
because it corresponds to common usage.

We like to use the word @lquotes@;unit@rquotes@; for declaration-plus-body things,
and @lquotes@;item@rquotes@; for declaration or body separately (as in
@nt{declarative_item}).
The terms @lquotes@;@nt{compilation_unit}@rquotes@;, @lquotes@;compilation unit@rquotes@;,
and @lquotes@;@nt{subunit}@rquotes@; are exceptions to this rule.
We considered changing @lquotes@;@nt{compilation_unit}@rquotes@;, @lquotes@;compilation unit@rquotes@;
to @lquotes@;@ntf{compilation_item}@rquotes@;, @lquotes@;compilation item@rquotes@;,
respectively, but we decided not to.
@end{Discussion}

@Defn2{Term=[parent declaration], Sec=(of a @nt{library_item})}
@Defn2{Term=[parent declaration], Sec=(of a library unit)}
The @i{parent declaration} of a @nt{library_item}
(and of the library unit) is the declaration denoted
by the @nt{parent_@!unit_name}, if any, of the
@nt{defining_@!program_@!unit_name} of the @nt<library_item>.
@Defn{root library unit}
If there is no @nt{parent_@!unit_name},
the parent declaration is the declaration of Standard,
the @nt{library_item} is a @i{root} @nt{library_item}, and
the library unit (renaming) is a @i{root} library
unit (renaming).
The declaration and body of Standard itself have no parent declaration.
@Defn2{Term=[parent unit], Sec=(of a library unit)}
The @i{parent unit} of a @nt{library_item} or library unit is the
library unit declared by its parent declaration.
@begin{Discussion}
The declaration and body of Standard are presumed to exist from
the beginning of time, as it were.
There is no way to actually write them,
since there is no syntactic way to indicate lack of a parent.
An attempt to compile a package Standard would result in
Standard.Standard.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Reason}
Library units (other than Standard)
have @lquotes@;parent declarations@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;parent units@rquotes@;.
Subunits have @lquotes@;parent bodies@rquotes@;.
We didn't bother to define the other possibilities:
parent body of a library unit,
parent declaration of a subunit,
parent unit of a subunit.
These are not needed,
and might get in the way of a correct definition of @lquotes@;child@rquotes@;.
@end{Reason}

@Redundant[The children of a library unit occur immediately
within the declarative region of the declaration of the library unit.]
@Defn2{Term=[ancestor], Sec=(of a library unit)}
The @i{ancestors} of a library unit are itself, its parent,
its parent's parent, and so on.
@Redundant[(Standard is an ancestor of every library unit.)]
@Defn{descendant}
The @i{descendant} relation is the inverse of the ancestor relation.
@begin{Reason}
These definitions are worded carefully to avoid defining subunits as
children. Only library units can be children.

We use the unadorned term @lquotes@;ancestors@rquotes@; here to concisely define both
@lquotes@;ancestor unit@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;ancestor declaration@rquotes@;.
@end{Reason}

@Defn{public library unit}
@Defn{public declaration of a library unit}
@Defn{private library unit}
@Defn{private declaration of a library unit}
A @nt<library_unit_declaration>
or a @nt<library_@!unit_@!renaming_@!declaration> is @i{private}
if the declaration is immediately preceded
by the reserved word @key{private};
it is otherwise @i{public}. A library unit is private or public
according to its declaration.
@Defn2{Term=[public descendant], Sec=(of a library unit)}
The @i{public descendants} of a library unit are the library unit
itself, and the public descendants of its public children.
@Defn2{Term=[private descendant], Sec=(of a library unit)}
Its other descendants are @i{private descendants}.
@begin{Discussion}
The first concept defined here is that a @nt<library_item> is either public
or private (not in relation to anything else @em it's just a property of
the library unit).
The second concept is that a @nt<library_item>
is a public descendant or
private descendant @i{of a given ancestor}.
A given @nt<library_item> can be a
public descendant of one of its ancestors,
but a private descendant of some other ancestor.

A subprogram declared by a @nt{subprogram_body}
(as opposed to a @nt{subprogram_declaration})
is always public,
since the syntax rules disallow the reserved word @key[private]
on a body.

Note that a private library unit is a @i{public}
descendant of itself,
but a @i{private} descendant of its parent.
This is because it is visible outside itself @em its
privateness means that it is not visible outside its
parent.

Private children of Standard are legal, and follow the normal rules.
It is intended that implementations might have some method for taking an
existing environment, and treating it as a package to be @lquotes@;imported@rquotes@; into
another environment, treating children of Standard in the imported environment
as children of the imported package.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Ramification}
@leading@;Suppose we have a public library unit A,
a private library unit A.B, and a public library unit A.B.C.
A.B.C is a public descendant of itself and of A.B,
but a private descendant of A;
since A.B is private to A, we don't allow A.B.C to escape outside A
either.
This is similar to the situation that would occur with physical
nesting, like this:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] A @key[is]
@key[private]
    @key[package] B @key[is]
        @key[package] C @key[is]
        @key[end] C;
    @key[private]
    @key[end] B;
@key[end] A;
@end{Example}

Here, A.B.C is visible outside itself and outside A.B, but not outside A.
(Note that this example is intended to illustrate the visibility
of program units from the outside;
the visibility within child units is not quite identical to that of
physically nested units,
since child units are nested after their parent's declaration.)

@begin{Discussion}
A child of an instance of a given generic unit

This is not required, however.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Reason}
@leading@;Instances are forbidden from having noninstance children for two reasons:
@begin(Enumerate)
We want all source code that can depend on information from
the private part of a library unit to be inside the "subsystem"
rooted at the library unit.
If an instance of a generic unit were allowed to have a noninstance
as a child, the source code of that child might depend on information
from the private part of the generic unit, even though it is outside
the subsystem rooted at the generic unit.

Disallowing noninstance children simplifies the description of the
semantics of children of generic packages.

For each @Chg{Version=[2],New=[child @i<C>],

@begin{ImplNote}
Within the child, like anything nested in a generic unit,
one can make up-level references to the current instance of its

parent, to the types declared in the parent, etc.
This @lquotes@;nesting@rquotes@; model applies even within the

as it does for a generic child of a nongeneric unit.
@end{ImplNote}
@begin{Ramification}

  Suppose P is a generic library package,
  and P.C is a generic child of P.
  P.C can be instantiated inside the declarative region of P.
  Outside P, P.C can be mentioned only in a @nt{with_clause}.
  Conceptually, an instance I of P is a package that has a nested
  generic unit called I.C.
  Mentioning P.C in a @nt{with_clause} allows I.C to be instantiated.
  I need not be a library unit,
  and the instantiation of I.C need not be a library unit.
  If I is a library unit, and an instance of I.C is a child of I,
  then this instance has to be called something other than C.

@end{Ramification}

A library subprogram shall not override a primitive subprogram.
@begin{Reason}
This prevents certain obscure anomalies.
For example, if a library subprogram were to override a subprogram
declared in its parent package, then in a compilation unit that depends
@i{in}directly on the library subprogram, the library subprogram could
hide the overridden operation from all visibility,
but the library subprogram itself would not be visible.

Note that even without this rule, such subprograms would be illegal for
tagged types, because of the freezing rules.
@end{Reason}

then the given compilation unit depends semantically upon the

@end{Honest}
@begin{Discussion}
For example, a compilation unit containing
X'Address depends semantically upon the declaration of package
System.

For the Address attribute, this fixes a hole in Ada 83.
Note that in almost all cases, the dependence will need to exist
due to @nt{with_clause}s, even without this rule.
Hence, the rule has very little effect on programmers.

Note that the semantic dependence does not have the same effect as a
@nt{with_clause}; in order to denote a declaration in one of those
packages, a @nt{with_clause} will generally be needed.

Note that no special rule is needed for an
@nt{attribute_definition_clause}, since an expression after @key[use]
will require semantic dependence upon the compilation unit containing
the @nt{type_declaration} of interest.

@begin{Notes}
A simple program may consist of a single compilation unit.
A @nt{compilation} need not have any compilation units;

Such @nt{pragma}s cannot have any arguments that are @nt{name}s,
by a previous rule of this subclause.
A @nt{compilation} can even be entirely empty,
which is probably not useful.

Some interesting properties of the three kinds of dependence:
The elaboration dependences also include the semantic dependences,
except that subunits are taken together with their parents.
The semantic dependences partly determine the order in which the
compilation units appear in the environment at compile time.
At run time, the order is partly determined by the elaboration
dependences.

@leading@;The model whereby a child is inside its parent's declarative region,
after the parent's declaration,
as explained in @RefSecNum{Declarative Region},
has the following ramifications:
@begin(itemize)
The restrictions on @lquotes@;early@rquotes@; use of a private type (RM83-7.4.1(4))
or a deferred constant (RM83-7.4.3(2))
do not apply to uses in child units, because they follow
the full declaration.

A library subprogram is never primitive, even if its profile includes a
type declared immediately within the parent's @nt{package_specification},
because the child is not declared immediately within the same
@nt{package_specification} as the type (so it doesn't declare a new
primitive subprogram), and because the child is forbidden from overriding
an old primitive subprogram. It is immediately within the same declarative
region, but not the same @nt{package_specification}. Thus, for a tagged type,
it is not possible to call a child subprogram in a dispatching manner.
(This is also forbidden by the freezing rules.)
Similarly, it is not possible for the user to declare primitive
subprograms of the types declared in the declaration of Standard,
such as Integer (even if the rules were changed to allow a library unit
whose name is an operator symbol).

When the parent unit is @lquotes@;used@rquotes@; the simple names of the
with'd child units are directly visible (see @RefSec{Use Clauses}).

When a parent body with's its own child, the defining name of
the child is directly visible, and the parent body
is not allowed to
include a declaration of a homograph of the child unit
immediately within the @nt{declarative_part} of the body
(RM83-8.3(17)).
@end(itemize)

Note that @lquotes@;declaration of a library unit@rquotes@;
is different from @lquotes@;@nt{library_unit_declaration}@rquotes@;
@em the former includes @nt{subprogram_body}.
Also, we sometimes really mean @lquotes@;declaration of a view of a
library unit@rquotes@;, which includes
@nt{library_@!unit_@!renaming_@!declaration}s.

The visibility rules generally imply that the renamed view of a
@nt{library_@!unit_@!renaming_@!declaration} has to be mentioned in a
@nt{with_@!clause} of the @nt{library_@!unit_@!renaming_@!declaration}.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Honest}
The real rule is that the renamed library unit
has to be visible in the @nt{library_@!unit_@!renaming_@!declaration}.
@end{Honest}
@begin{Reason}
In most cases, @lquotes@;has to be visible@rquotes@; means there has to be a
@nt{with_clause}.
However, it is possible in obscure cases to avoid the need for a
@nt{with_clause}; in particular, a compilation unit such as
@lquotes@;@key[package] P.Q @key[renames] P;@rquotes@;
is legal with no @nt{with_clause}s
(though not particularly interesting).
ASCII is physically nested in Standard,
and so is not a library unit,
and cannot be renamed as a library unit.
@end{Reason}

The @nt{designator} of a library function cannot be an @nt{operator_symbol},
but a nonlibrary @nt{renaming_declaration} is allowed to rename a library
function as an operator.
Within a partition,
two library subprograms are required to have distinct
names and hence cannot overload each other.
However,
@nt{renaming_declaration}s are allowed to define overloaded names for
such subprograms, and a locally declared subprogram is allowed to
overload a library subprogram. The expanded name Standard.L can be
used to denote a root library unit L (unless the declaration of
Standard is hidden)
since root library unit declarations occur immediately within the
declarative region of package Standard.

@begin{Notes}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00217-06]}
A @nt<library_item> mentioned in a @Chg{Version=[2],
New=[@nt{nonlimited_with_clause}],Old=[@nt{with_clause}]} of a compilation unit
is visible within the compilation unit and hence acts
just like an ordinary declaration.
Thus, within a compilation unit that mentions its declaration, the name of a
library package can be given in @nt{use_clause}s and can be used to
form expanded names, a library subprogram can be called,
and instances of a generic library unit can be declared.
If a child of a parent generic package is mentioned in a
@Chg{Version=[2], New=[@nt{nonlimited_with_clause}],Old=[@nt{with_clause}]},
then the corresponding declaration nested within each visible instance
is visible within the compilation unit.@Chg{Version=[2], New=[ Similarly,
a @nt{library_item} mentioned in a
@nt{limited_with_clause} of a compilation unit is visible within the
compilation unit and thus can be used to form expanded names.],Old=[]}

@begin{Ramification}
The rules given for @nt{with_clause}s are such that the same effect
is obtained whether the name of a library unit is mentioned once or
more than once by the applicable @nt{with_clause}s, or even within a
given @nt{with_clause}.

If a @nt{with_clause} mentions a
@nt{library_@!unit_@!renaming_@!declaration},
it only @lquotes@;mentions@rquotes@; the @nt<prefix>es appearing explicitly
in the @nt<with_clause>
(and the renamed view itself);
the @nt{with_clause} is not defined to mention the ancestors of the
renamed entity.
Thus, if X renames Y.Z, then @lquotes@;with X;@rquotes@; does not make the
declarations of Y or Z visible.
Note that this does not cause the dreaded visibility holes mentioned
above.

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The syntax rule for @nt{with_clause} is modified to allow expanded name
notation.

A @nt<use_clause> in a @nt<context_clause> may be for
a package (or type) nested in a library package.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The syntax rule for @nt{context_clause} is modified to more closely reflect
the semantics.
The Ada 83 syntax rule implies that the @nt{use_clause}s that appear
immediately after a particular @nt{with_clause} are somehow attached to
that @nt{with_clause}, which is not true.
The new syntax allows a @nt{use_clause} to appear first,
but that is prevented by a textual rule that already exists in Ada 83.

The concept of @lquotes@;scope of a @nt{with_clause}@rquotes@; (which is a region of text)
replaces RM83's notion of @lquotes@;apply to@rquotes@;
(a @nt{with_clause} applies to a @nt{library_item})
The visibility rules are interested in a region of text,
not in a set of compilation units.

No need to define @lquotes@;apply to@rquotes@; for @nt{use_clause}s.
Their semantics are fully covered by the @lquotes@;scope (of a @nt{use_clause})@rquotes@;

@begin{Notes}
@leading@;The rules in @RefSec{The Compilation Process}
say that a @nt{body_stub} is equivalent to the corresponding
@nt{proper_body}. This implies:
@begin{Itemize}
Visibility within a subunit is the
visibility that would be obtained at the place of the corresponding
@nt{body_stub} (within the parent body) if the
@nt{context_clause} of the subunit were appended to
that of the parent body.
@begin{Ramification}
Recursively.
Note that this transformation might make the parent illegal;
hence it is not a true equivalence, but applies only to visibility
within the subunit.
@end{Ramification}

The effect of the elaboration of a @nt{body_stub} is to elaborate
the subunit.
@begin{Ramification}
The elaboration of a subunit is part of its parent body's elaboration,
whereas the elaboration of a child unit is not part of its parent
declaration's elaboration.
@end{Ramification}
@end{Itemize}
@begin{Ramification}
A @nt<library_item> that is mentioned in a @nt{with_clause} of a
subunit can be hidden (from direct @Chg{Version=[2],New=[visibility],
Old=[visiblity]}) by a declaration (with the same
@nt{identifier}) given in the subunit.
Moreover, such a @nt<library_item> can even be hidden by a declaration
given within the parent body since a library unit is declared in its
parent's declarative region; this however does not affect the
interpretation of the @nt{with_clause}s themselves, since only
@nt<library_item>s
are visible or directly visible
in @nt{with_clause}s.

The body of a protected operation cannot be a subunit.
This follows from the syntax rules.
The body of a protected unit can be a subunit.
@end{Ramification}
@end{Notes}

@begin{Examples}
@leading@keepnext@;The package Parent is first written without subunits:

@LabeledSubClause{The Compilation Process}

@begin{Intro}
@Defn{environment}
@Defn{environment @nt<declarative_part>}
Each compilation unit submitted to the compiler is compiled in the
context of an @i{environment} @nt<declarative_part> (or simply, an
@i{environment}),
which is a conceptual @nt<declarative_part> that forms
the outermost declarative region of the
context of any @nt{compilation}.
At run time, an environment forms the @nt<declarative_part> of
the body of the environment task of a partition
(see @RefSec{Program Execution}).
@begin{Ramification}
At compile time, there is no particular construct that the
declarative region is considered to be nested within
@em the environment is the universe.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Honest}
The environment is really just a portion of a @nt{declarative_part},
since there might, for example, be bodies that do not yet exist.
@end{Honest}

The @nt{declarative_item}s of the environment
are @nt{library_item}s appearing in an order
such that there are no forward semantic dependences.
Each included subunit
occurs in place of the corresponding stub.
The visibility rules apply as if the environment were the outermost
declarative region,
except that @nt{with_@!clause}s are needed to make
declarations of library units visible
(see @RefSecNum{Context Clauses - With Clauses}).

@begin{Ramification}
The traditional model, used by most Ada 83 implementations,
is that one places a compilation unit in the environment
by compiling it.
Other models are possible.
For example, an implementation might define the environment to
be a directory;
that is, the compilation units in the environment are all the
compilation units in the source files contained in the directory.
In this model, the mechanism for replacing a compilation unit with a
new one is simply to edit the source file containing that compilation
unit.

@PDefn{type conformance}
@begin{Ramification}
  The principle here is that a @nt{subprogram_body} should be
  interpreted as only a completion if and only if it @lquotes@;might@rquotes@;
  be legal as the completion of some preexisting declaration,
  where @lquotes@;might@rquotes@; is defined in a way that does not require overload
  resolution to determine.

  Hence, if the preexisting declaration is a @nt{subprogram_declaration}
  or @nt{generic_subprogram_declaration}, we treat the new
  @nt{subprogram_body} as its completion, because it @lquotes@;might@rquotes@; be legal.
  If it turns out that the profiles don't fully conform,
  it's an error.
  In all other cases (the preexisting declaration is a
  package or a generic package,
  or an instance of a generic subprogram,
  or a renaming,
  or a @lquotes@;spec-less@rquotes@; subprogram,
  or in the case where there is no preexisting thing),
  the @nt{subprogram_body} declares a new subprogram.

@begin{Legality}
When a compilation unit is compiled,
all compilation units upon which it depends semantically
shall already exist in the environment;
@Defn2{Term=[consistency], Sec=(among compilation units)}
the set of these compilation units shall be @i{consistent} in the
sense that the new compilation unit shall not semantically depend
(directly or indirectly) on two different versions of the same compilation
unit, nor on an earlier version of itself.
@begin{Discussion}
For example, if package declarations A and B both say
@lquotes@;@key[with] X;@rquotes@;, and the user compiles a compilation unit that says
@lquotes@;@key[with] A, B;@rquotes@;, then the A and B have to be talking about the
same version of X.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Ramification}
  What it means to be a @lquotes@;different version@rquotes@; is not specified by the
  language. In some implementations, it means that the compilation
  unit has been recompiled. In others, it means that the
  source of the compilation unit has been edited in some significant way.

Note that an implementation cannot require the existence of
compilation units upon which the given one does not semantically
depend.
For example, an implementation is required to be able to compile a
compilation unit that says "@key{with} A;" when A's body does not
exist.
It has to be able to detect errors without looking at A's body.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}

subprogram for which @Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspect],Old=[a @nt{pragma}]}

the implementation may also remove any compilation unit containing a
call to that subprogram.
@begin{Ramification}

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0005-1]}
The permissions given in this paragraph correspond to the traditional
model, where compilation units enter the environment by being
compiled into it, and the compiler checks their legality at that time.
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[An],Old=[A]} implementation model in which the
environment consists of all source files in a given directory might not
want to take advantage of these permissions.
Compilation units would not be checked for
legality as soon as they enter the environment; legality checking
would happen later, when compilation units are compiled.
In this model, compilation units might never be automatically removed
from the environment;
they would be removed when the user explicitly deletes a source file.

Note that the rule is recursive: if the above permission is used to
remove a compilation unit containing an inlined subprogram call,
then compilation units that depend semantically upon the removed one
may also be removed, and so on.

Note that here we are talking about dependences among existing
compilation units in the environment;
it doesn't matter what @nt{with_clause}s are attached to the new
compilation unit that triggered all this.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
An implementation may have other modes in which compilation units
in addition to the ones mentioned above are removed.
For example, an implementation might inline subprogram calls without
an explicit @Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspect],Old=[@nt{pragma}]} Inline.
If so, it either has to have a mode in which that optimization is
turned off, or it has to automatically regenerate code for the inlined
calls without requiring the user to resubmit them to the compiler.

@Defn{library}
An implementation may support a concept of a @i{library},
which contains @nt{library_item}s.
If multiple libraries are supported,
the implementation has to define how a single environment is
constructed when a compilation unit is submitted to the compiler.
Naming conflicts between different libraries might be resolved by
treating each library as the root of a hierarchy of child library
units.
@IndexSee{Term=[program library],See=(library)}
@begin{ImplNote}
Alternatively, naming conflicts could be resolved via some sort of
hiding rule.
@end{ImplNote}
@begin{Discussion}
For example, the implementation might support a command to import
library Y into library X.
If a root library unit called LU (that is, Standard.LU) exists in Y,
then from the point of view of library X,
it could be called Y.LU.
X might contain library units that say, @lquotes@;@key[with] Y.LU;@rquotes@;.
@end{Discussion}

A compilation unit containing an instantiation of a separately
compiled generic unit does not semantically depend on the body
of the generic unit.
Therefore, replacing the generic body in the environment
does not result in the removal of the compilation unit
containing the instantiation.
@begin{ImplNote}
  Therefore, implementations have to be prepared to automatically
  instantiate generic bodies at link-time, as needed. This might
  imply a complete automatic recompilation, but it is the intent
  of the language that generic bodies can be (re)instantiated without
  forcing all of the compilation units that semantically depend
  on the compilation unit containing the instantiation to be
  recompiled.

@begin{ImplReq}
@Leading@;The implementation shall ensure that all compilation units
included in a partition are consistent with one another,
and are legal according to the rules of the language.
@begin{Discussion}
The consistency requirement implies that
a partition cannot contain two versions of the same compilation unit.
That is,
a partition cannot contain two different library units with the
same full expanded name, nor two different bodies for the same
program unit.
For example, suppose we compile the following:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] A @key[is] --@RI{ Version 1.}
    ...
@key[end] A;

@key[with] A;
@key[package] B @key[is]
@key[end] B;

@key[package] A @key[is] --@RI{ Version 2.}
    ...
@key[end] A;

@key[with] A;
@key[package] C @key[is]
@key[end] C;
@end{Example}

It would be wrong for a partition containing B and C to contain both
versions of A.
Typically, the implementation would require the use of Version 2 of A,
which might require the recompilation of B.
Alternatively, the implementation might automatically recompile B
when the partition is built.
A third alternative would be an incremental compiler that,
when Version 2 of A is compiled,
automatically patches the object code for B to reflect the changes to
A (if there are any relevant changes @em there might not be any).

An implementation that supported fancy version management
might allow the use of Version 1 in some circumstances.
In no case can the implementation allow the use of both versions in
the same partition
(unless, of course, it can prove that the two versions are
semantically identical).

The core language says nothing about inter-partition
consistency; see also @RefSec{Distributed Systems}.
@end{Discussion}
@end{ImplReq}

@begin{ImplPerm}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
@Defn{active partition}
The kind of partition described in this @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}
is known as an @i{active} partition.
An implementation is allowed to support other kinds of partitions,
with implementation-defined semantics.
@ImplDef{The semantics of any nonactive partitions supported by the
implementation.}
@begin{Discussion}
@RefSec{Distributed Systems} defines the concept of passive partitions;
they may be thought of as a partition without an environment task,
or as one with a particularly simple form of environment task,
having an infinite loop rather than a call on a main subprogram
as its @nt<sequence_of_statements>.
@end{Discussion}

An implementation may restrict the kinds of subprograms it supports
as main subprograms.
However, an implementation is required to support all main
subprograms that are public parameterless library procedures.
@begin{Ramification}
The implementation is required to support main subprograms that are
procedures declared by @nt{generic_instantiation}s,
as well as those
that are children of library units other than Standard.
Generic units are, of course, not allowed to be main subprograms,
since they are not subprograms.

Note that renamings are irrelevant to this rule.
This rules says which subprograms (not views)
have to be supported.
The implementation can choose any way it wants for the
user to indicate which subprogram should be the main subprogram.
An implementation might allow any name of any view,
including those declared by renamings.
Another implementation might require it to be the original name.
Another implementation still might use the name of the source file or
some such thing.
@end{Ramification}

If the environment task completes abnormally,
the implementation may abort any dependent tasks.
@begin{Reason}
If the implementation does not take advantage of this permission,
the normal action takes place @em the environment task awaits those
tasks.

The possibility of aborting them
is not shown in the @i{Environment_Task} code above,
because there is nowhere to put an @nt{exception_handler} that can
handle exceptions raised in both the environment @nt{declarative_part}
and the main subprogram,
such that the dependent tasks can be aborted.
If we put an @nt{exception_handler} in the body of the environment
task, then it won't handle exceptions that occur during elaboration of
the environment @nt{declarative_part}.
If we were to move those things into a nested @nt{block_statement},
with the @nt{exception_handler} outside that,
then the @nt{block_statement} would await the library tasks we are
trying to abort.

Furthermore, this is merely a permission, and is not fundamental to the
model, so it is probably better to state it separately anyway.

Note that implementations (and tools like debuggers)
can have modes that provide other behaviors in addition.
@end{Reason}
@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{Notes}
An implementation may provide inter-partition
communication mechanism(s) via special packages and pragmas.
Standard pragmas for distribution and methods for specifying
inter-partition communication are defined in @RefSec{Distributed Systems}.
If no such mechanisms are provided, then each partition is isolated from all
others, and behaves as a program in and of itself.
@begin{Ramification}
Not providing such mechanisms is equivalent to disallowing multi-partition
programs.

An implementation may provide mechanisms to facilitate checking the
consistency of library units elaborated in different partitions;
@RefSec{Distributed Systems} does so.
@end{Ramification}

Partitions are not required to run in separate address spaces.
For example, an implementation might support dynamic linking
via the partition concept.

@ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[AddedNormal],ARef=[AI12-0417-1]}
An order of elaboration of @nt{library_item}s that is consistent with
the partial ordering defined above does not always ensure that each
@nt{library_unit_body} is elaborated before any other compilation unit
whose elaboration necessitates that the @nt{library_unit_body} be
already elaborated.
(In particular, there is no requirement that the body of a library unit
be elaborated as soon as possible after the
@nt{library_unit_declaration} is elaborated,
unless the pragmas@Chg{Version=[5],New=[ or aspects],Old=[]} in subclause
@RefSecNum{Elaboration Control} are used.)

A partition (active or otherwise) need not have a main subprogram.
In such a case, all the work done by the partition would be done by
elaboration of various @nt{library_item}s, and by tasks created by that
elaboration.
Passive partitions, which cannot have main subprograms,
are defined in @RefSec{Distributed Systems}.
@begin{Ramification}
The environment task is the outermost semantic level
defined by the language.

Standard has no private part.
This prevents strange implementation-dependences involving private
children of Standard having visibility upon Standard's private part.
It doesn't matter where the body of Standard appears in the environment,
since it doesn't do anything.
See @RefSec{Predefined Language Environment}.

Note that elaboration dependence is carefully defined in such a way that
if (say) the body of something doesn't exist yet,
then there is no elaboration dependence upon the nonexistent body.
(This follows from the fact that @lquotes@;needed by@rquotes@; is defined that way,
and the elaboration dependences caused by a @nt{pragma} Elaborate or
Elaborate_All are defined in terms of @lquotes@;needed by@rquotes@;.)
This property allows us to use the environment concept both at compile
time and at partition-construction time/run time.
@end{Ramification}

@Redundant[@Defn{elaboration control}
This subclause defines @Chg{Version=[5],New=[aspects and ],Old=[]}pragmas that
help control the elaboration order of @nt{library_item}s.]
@end{Intro}

@begin{MetaRules}
The rules governing preelaboration are designed to allow
it to be done largely by bulk initialization of statically
allocated storage from information in a @lquotes@;load module@rquotes@; created by a linker.
Some implementations may require run-time code to be executed in some
cases, but we consider these cases rare enough that we need not
further complicate the rules.

It is important that programs be able to declare data structures that
are link-time initialized with @nt{aggregate}s, @nt{string_literal}s,
and concatenations thereof.
It is important to be able to write link-time evaluated expressions
involving the First, Last, and Length attributes of such data structures
(including variables), because they might be initialized with positional
@nt{aggregate}s or @nt{string_literal}s, and we don't want the user to
have to count the elements.
There is no corresponding need for accessing discriminants,
since they can be initialized with a static constant,
and then the constant can be referred to elsewhere.
It is important to allow link-time initialized data structures
involving discriminant-dependent components.
It is important to be able to write link-time evaluated expressions
involving pointers (both access values and addresses)
to the above-mentioned data structures.

The rules also ensure that no Elaboration_Check need be performed
for calls on library-level subprograms declared within
a preelaborated package.
This is true also of the Elaboration_Check on task activation
for library level task types declared in a preelaborated package.
However, it is not true of the Elaboration_Check on instantiations.

A static expression should never prevent a library unit from being
preelaborable.

  type is used to declare a private extension in another pure package,
  and the full type for the private extension has a component of an
  explicitly limited record type, a protected type, or a type with
  access discriminants, then the stream attributes will have to be
  user-specified in the visible part of the package. That is not a requirement
  for Ada 95, but this combination seems very unlikely in pure packages.
