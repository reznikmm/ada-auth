@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
This @Chg{Version=[3],New=[clause],Old=[section]} describes the types
in the language and the rules for declaring constants, variables, and
named numbers.

@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0373-1]}
@PDefn{entity}
The language defines
several kinds of named @i(entities) that are declared
by declarations.
@PDefn{name}
The entity's @i(name)
is defined by the declaration, usually by a
@nt<defining_@!identifier>,
but sometimes by a @nt{defining_@!character_@!literal}
or @nt{defining_@!operator_@!symbol}.@Chg{Version=[5],New=[
There are also entities that are not directly declared; some
of these are elements of other entities, or are
allocated dynamically. Such entities can be denoted using
@nt{indexed_component}, @nt{selected_component}, or dereference @nt{name}s
(see @RefSecNum{Names}).],Old=[]}

@begin{Discussion}
  @ChgRef{Version=[5],Kind=[AddedNormal],ARef=[AI12-0373-1]}
  @ChgAdded{Version=[5],Text=[Some entities are always anonymous. For instance,
  a type is never named (the name represents the first subtype).

There are several forms of declaration. A @nt<basic_declaration>
is a form of declaration defined as follows.

@begin(Discussion)
  This list (when @nt<basic_declaration> is expanded out)
  contains all syntactic categories that end in "_declaration"
  or "_specification", except for program unit _specifications.
  Moreover, it contains @nt{subprogram_body}.
  A @nt{subprogram_body} is a declaration,
  whether or not it completes a previous declaration.
  This is a bit strange, @nt{subprogram_body} is not part of the syntax
  of @nt{basic_declaration} or @nt{library_unit_declaration}.
  A renaming-as-body is considered a declaration.
  An @nt{accept_statement} is not considered a declaration.
  Completions are sometimes declarations, and sometimes not.
@end(Discussion)

@Defn(view)@Defn(definition)
All declarations contain a @i(definition) for a @i(view) of an entity.
A view consists of an identification of the entity
(the entity @i(of) the view),
plus view-specific characteristics that affect the use
of the entity through that view (such as mode of access to an object,
formal parameter names and defaults for a subprogram, or visibility to
components of a type).
In most cases, a declaration also contains the definition for the
entity itself (a @nt(renaming_declaration) is an example of a declaration
that does not define a new entity,
but instead defines a view of an existing entity
(see @RefSecNum(Renaming Declarations))).

@ChgToGlossary{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],Term=<View>,
Text=<@Chg{Version=[2],New=[A view of an entity reveals some or all of the
properties of the entity. A single entity may have multiple views.],
Old=[(See @b[Definition].)]}>}
@begin{Discussion}
  Most declarations define a view (of some entity) whose
  view-specific characteristics are unchanging for the
  life of the view. However, subtypes are somewhat unusual
  in that they inherit characteristics from whatever view
  of their type is currently visible. Hence, a subtype is not a
  @i(view) of a type; it is more of an indirect reference.
  By contrast, a private type provides a single, unchanging (partial)
  view of its full type.

  (for tagged objects) components which are not components of the nominal
  type of the object (see @RefSecNum{Type Extensions}). Other terms, such
  as @ldquote@;subcomponent@rdquote and @ldquote@;part@rdquote, are
  interpreted analogously.]}
@end{Discussion}

@PDefn2{Term=[scope], Sec=(informal definition)}
For each declaration, the language rules define a certain
region of text called the @i(scope) of the declaration
(see @RefSecNum(Scope of Declarations)). Most declarations
associate an @nt<identifier>
with a declared entity. Within its scope,
and only there, there are places where it is possible to use the
@nt<identifier> to refer to the declaration, the view it defines,
and the associated entity; these places are defined by
the visibility rules (see @RefSecNum(Visibility)).
@Defn2{Term=[name], Sec={of (a view of) an entity}}
At such places
the @nt<identifier> is said to be a @i(name) of the entity (the
@nt<direct_name> or @nt<selector_name>);
@PDefn2{Term=[denote], Sec={informal definition}}
the name is said to @i(denote) the declaration,
the view, and the associated entity
(see @RefSecNum{The Context of Overload Resolution}).
@Defn{declare}
The declaration is said
to @i(declare) the name, the view, and in most cases, the
entity itself.

As an alternative to an @nt<identifier>,
an enumeration literal can be declared with a @nt<character_literal>
as its name (see @RefSecNum(Enumeration Types)),
and a function can be declared with an @nt<operator_symbol>
as its name (see @RefSecNum(Subprogram Declarations)).

@Defn{defining name}
The syntax rules use the terms @nt<defining_identifier>,
@nt<defining_@!character_@!literal>, and @nt<defining_@!operator_@!symbol>
for the defining occurrence of a name; these are collectively
called @i(defining names).
@Defn{usage name}
The terms @nt<direct_name> and
@nt<selector_name> are used for usage occurrences of @nt<identifier>s,
@nt<character_literal>s, and @nt<operator_symbol>s. These
are collectively called @i(usage names).
@begin(Honest)
The terms @nt<identifier>,
@nt<character_literal>, and @nt<operator_symbol> are used directly
in contexts where the normal visibility rules do not
apply (such as the @nt<identifier> that appears after the @key(end) of
a @nt<task_body>). Analogous conventions apply to the use of @nt<designator>,
which is the collective term for @nt<identifier> and @nt<operator_symbol>.
@end(Honest)

@end{StaticSem}

@begin{RunTime}
@RootDefn{execution}
The process by which a construct achieves its run-time effect is
called @i(execution).
@RootDefn{elaboration}
@RootDefn{evaluation}
This process is also called @i(elaboration) for declarations
and @i(evaluation) for expressions.
One of the terms execution, elaboration, or evaluation is defined
by this International Standard for each construct that has a run-time effect.
@ToGlossary{Term=<Execution>,
  Text=<The process by which a construct achieves its run-time effect is
  called @i(execution).
  @Defn(elaboration)
  @Defn(evaluation)
  Execution of a declaration is also called @i(elaboration).
  Execution of an expression is also called @i(evaluation).>}
@begin{Honest}
The term elaboration is also used for the execution of certain
constructs that are not declarations,
and the term evaluation is used for the execution of certain
constructs that are not expressions.
For example, @nt{subtype_indication}s are elaborated,
and @nt{range}s are evaluated.

For bodies, execution and elaboration are both explicitly defined.
When we refer specifically to the execution of a body,
we mean the explicit definition of execution for that kind of body,
not its elaboration.
@end{Honest}
@begin(Discussion)
Technically, "the execution of a declaration" and "the
elaboration of a declaration" are synonymous.
We use the term "elaboration" of a construct when we know the
construct is elaborable.
When we are talking about more arbitrary constructs,
we use the term "execution".
For example, we use the term "erroneous execution",
to refer to any erroneous execution, including
erroneous elaboration or evaluation.

When we explicitly define evaluation or elaboration for a construct,
we are implicitly defining execution of that construct.

We also use the term "execution" for things like @nt{statement}s,
which are executable, but neither elaborable nor evaluable.
We considered using the term "execution" only for nonelaborable,
nonevaluable constructs, and defining the term "action" to mean what
we have defined "execution" to mean.
We rejected this idea because we thought three terms that mean the
same thing was enough @em four would be overkill.
Thus, the term "action" is used only informally in the standard
(except where it is defined as part of a larger term,
such as "protected action").

@end{Honest}
@begin(Discussion)
  Don't confuse @lquotes@;elaborable@rquotes@; with @lquotes@;preelaborable@rquotes@; (defined
  in @RefSecNum(Elaboration Control)).

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
  Evaluation of an evaluable construct produces a result that is
  either a value, a denotation, or a range.
  The following are evaluable:
  expression; @nt{name}
  @nt{prefix}; @nt{range};
  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt{entry_index_specification}],Old=[@ntf{entry_list_iterator}]};
  and possibly @nt{discrete_range}.
  The last one is curious @em RM83 uses the term @lquotes@;evaluation of a
  @nt{discrete_range},@rquotes@; but never defines it.
  One might presume that the evaluation of a @nt{discrete_range}
  consists of the evaluation of the @nt{range} or the
  @nt{subtype_indication}, depending on what it is.
  But @nt{subtype_indication}s are not evaluated; they are elaborated.

  Intuitively, an @i(executable) construct is one that has
  a defined run-time effect (which may be null). Since execution
  includes elaboration and evaluation as special cases, all
  elaborable and all evaluable constructs
  are also executable. Hence, most constructs in Ada are executable.
  An important exception is that the constructs inside a generic unit are
  not executable directly, but rather are used as a template for
  (generally) executable constructs in instances of the generic.
@end(Discussion)
@end{RunTime}

@begin{Notes}
@Defn{declare}
At compile time, the declaration of an entity @i(declares) the entity.
@Defn{create}
At run time, the elaboration of the declaration @i(creates) the entity.
@begin{Ramification}
Syntactic categories for declarations are named either
@i(entity_)@ntf<declaration> (if they include a trailing semicolon)
or @i(entity_)@ntf<specification> (if not).

@Defn{entity}
The various kinds of named entities that can be declared are as
follows: an object (including components and parameters), a named number,
a type (the name always refers to its first subtype), a subtype,
a subprogram (including enumeration literals and operators), a single entry,
an entry family, a package, a protected or task unit (which corresponds
to either a type or a single object), an exception,
a generic unit, a label,
and the name of a statement.

Identifiers are also associated with names of pragmas, arguments to
pragmas, and with attributes, but these are not user-definable.
@end{Ramification}
@end{Notes}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The syntax rule for @nt{defining_identifier} is new.
It is used for the defining occurrence of an @nt{identifier}.
Usage occurrences use the @nt{direct_name} or @nt{selector_name}
syntactic categories.
@Leading@;Each occurrence of an @nt{identifier} (or @ntf{simple_name}), @nt{character_literal}, or
@nt{operator_symbol} in the Ada 83 syntax rules is handled as follows in Ada
95:
@begin{itemize}
It becomes a @nt{defining_identifier}, @nt{defining_character_literal}, or
@nt{defining_operator_symbol} (or some syntactic category composed of these),
to indicate a defining occurrence;

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
It becomes a @nt{direct_name}, in usage occurrences where
the usage is required (in @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Visibility Rules}) to be directly visible;

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
It becomes a @nt{selector_name}, in usage occurrences
where the usage is required (in
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]} @RefSecNum{Visibility Rules})
to be visible but not necessarily directly visible;

It remains an @nt{identifier}, @nt{character_literal}, or @nt{operator_symbol},
in cases where the visibility rules do not apply
(such as the @nt{designator} that appears after the
@key{end} of a @nt{subprogram_body}).
@end{itemize}

For declarations that come in @lquotes@;two parts@rquotes@;
(program unit declaration plus body, private or
incomplete type plus full type, deferred constant plus full constant),
we consider both to be defining occurrences.
Thus, for example, the syntax for @nt{package_body} uses
@nt{defining_identifier} after the reserved word @key{body},
as opposed to @nt{direct_name}.

The defining occurrence of a statement name is in
its implicit declaration, not where it appears in the program text.
Considering the statement name itself to be the defining occurrence would
complicate the visibility rules.

The phrase @lquotes@;visible by selection@rquotes@;
is not used in Ada 95. It is subsumed by simply @lquotes@;visible@rquotes@; and
the Name Resolution Rules for @nt<selector_name>s.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
(Note that in Ada 95, a declaration is visible at all
places where one could have used a @nt{selector_name},
not just at places where a @nt{selector_name} was actually used.
Thus, the places where a declaration is directly visible are a
subset of the places where it is visible.
See @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
@RefSecNum{Visibility Rules} for details.)

We use the term @lquotes@;declaration@rquotes@; to cover @ntf<_specification>s that declare
(views of) objects, such as @nt<parameter_specification>s. In Ada 83,
these are referred to as a @lquotes@;form of declaration,@rquotes@; but it is not
entirely clear that they are considered simply @lquotes@;declarations.@rquotes@;

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
RM83 contains an incomplete definition of "elaborated" in this
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}:
it defines "elaborated" for declarations,
@nt{declarative_part}s, @nt{declarative_item}s
and @nt{compilation_unit}s,
but "elaboration" is defined elsewhere for various other constructs.
To make matters worse, Ada 95 has a different set of elaborable
constructs.
Instead of correcting the list, it is more maintainable to
refer to the term "elaborable," which is defined in a distributed
manner.

RM83 uses the term @lquotes@;has no other effect@rquotes@; to describe an elaboration that
doesn't do anything except change the state from not-yet-elaborated to
elaborated. This was a confusing wording, because the answer to @lquotes@;other than
what?@rquotes@; was to be found many pages away.
In Ada 95, we change this wording to @lquotes@;has no effect@rquotes@; (for things that truly
do nothing at run time), and @lquotes@;has no effect other than to establish that
so-and-so can happen without failing the
Elaboration_Check@rquotes@; (for things where it matters).

We make it clearer that the term "execution" covers elaboration and
evaluation as special cases.
This was implied in RM83.
For example, "erroneous execution" can include any execution,
and RM83-9.4(3) has,
"The task designated by any other task object depends on the master
whose execution creates the task object;"
the elaboration of the master's @nt{declarative_part} is doing
the task creation.

A subtype is called an @i(unconstrained) subtype if its
type has unknown discriminants,
or if its type allows range, index, or discriminant constraints,
but the subtype does not impose such a constraint;
otherwise, the subtype is called a @i(constrained) subtype
(since it has no unconstrained characteristics).
@begin{Discussion}
  In an earlier version of Ada 9X,
  "constrained" meant "has a nonnull
  constraint." However, we changed to this definition
  since we kept having to special
  case composite non-array/nondiscriminated types. It also corresponds
  better to the (now obsolescent) attribute 'Constrained.

  For scalar types, @lquotes@;constrained@rquotes@; means @lquotes@;has a nonnull
  constraint@rquotes@;.
  For composite types, in implementation terms, @lquotes@;constrained@rquotes@; means
  that the size of all objects of the subtype is the same, assuming a
  typical implementation model.

  Class-wide subtypes are always unconstrained.

  We no longer talk about the implicit declaration of basic operations.

@Defn{predefined type}
The @i{predefined types}
@Redundant[(for example the types
Boolean, Wide_Character, Integer,
@i{root_integer}, and @i{universal_integer})]
are the types that are defined in
@Redundant[a predefined library package called] Standard@Redundant[;
this package also includes the @Redundant{(implicit)}

The elaboration of a @nt{full_type_declaration} consists of the
elaboration of the full type definition.
@PDefn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(full type definition)}
Each elaboration of a full type definition
creates a distinct type and its first subtype.
@begin{Reason}
  The creation is associated with the type @i(definition), rather than
  the type @i(declaration), because there are types
  that are created by full type definitions that are
  not immediately contained within a type declaration (e.g.
  an array object declaration, a singleton task declaration, etc.).
@end{Reason}

@begin{Notes}
Each of the above examples declares a named type. The identifier
given denotes the first subtype of the type. Other named subtypes of the
type can be declared with @nt<subtype_declaration>s
(see @RefSecNum{Subtype Declarations}). Although names do not directly
denote types, a phrase like @lquotes@;the type Column@rquotes@; is sometimes used
in this International Standard to refer to the type of Column, where Column denotes
the first subtype of the type. For an example of the definition
of an anonymous type, see the declaration
of the array Color_Table in @RefSecNum{Object Declarations}; its type
is anonymous @em it has no nameable subtypes.
@end{Notes}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The syntactic category @nt{full_type_declaration} now includes task and
protected type declarations.

We have generalized the concept of first-named subtype (now
called simply @lquotes@;first subtype@rquotes@;) to cover all kinds of types, for uniformity
of description elsewhere.
RM83 defined first-named subtype in Section 13.
We define first subtype here, because it is now a more fundamental concept.
We renamed the term, because in Ada 95 some first subtypes have no
name.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[AddedNormal],ARef=[AI95-00230-01]}
We no longer elaborate @nt{discriminant_part}s, because
there is nothing to do, and it was complex to say that you only wanted
to elaborate it once for a private or incomplete type. This is also
consistent with the fact that subprogram specifications are not
elaborated (neither in Ada 83 nor in Ada 95). Note, however, that an
@nt<access_definition> appearing in a @nt<discriminant_part> is
elaborated@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ at the @nt{full_type_declaration} (for

The elaboration of a @nt{subtype_indication} creates a new subtype.

constraint as that denoted by the @nt{subtype_mark}.
The elaboration of a @nt{subtype_indication} that includes a

the @nt<constraint> is @i(compatible) with the

The value of a variable

@begin{Ramification}
Reading and updating are intended to include read/write references of
any kind, even if they are not associated with the evaluation of a
particular construct. Consider, for example, the expression
@lquotes@;X.@key[all](F)@rquotes@;,
where X is an access-to-array object, and F is a function.
The implementation is allowed to first evaluate @lquotes@;X.@key[all]@rquotes@;
and then F.
Finally, a read is performed to get the value of the F'th component of
the array.
Note that the array is not necessarily read as part of the evaluation of
@lquotes@;X.@key[all]@rquotes@;.
This is important, because if F were to free X using
Unchecked_Deallocation, we want the execution of the final read to be
erroneous.

@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
There are additional kinds of objects (choice parameters and
entry indices of entry bodies).

The result of a function and of evaluating an aggregate
are considered (constant) objects. This is necessary to explain
the action of finalization on such things.
Because a @nt<function_call> is also syntactically a @nt<name>
(see @RefSecNum(Names)), the result of a @nt{function_call} can be renamed,
thereby allowing repeated use of the result without calling
the function again.

now @Chg{Version=[3],New=[follows],Old=[follow]} the
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[],Old=[clause and ]}subclauses on types and subtypes,
to cut down on the number of forward references.

The term nominal subtype is new. It is used to distinguish
what is known at compile time about an object's constraint, versus what
its "true" run-time constraint is.

The terms definite and indefinite (which apply to
subtypes) are new.
They are used to aid in the description of generic formal
type matching,
and to specify when an explicit initial value is required
in an @nt<object_declaration>.

We have moved the syntax for @nt<object_declaration> and
@nt<number_declaration> down into their respective subclauses, to
keep the syntax close to the description of the associated semantics.

We talk about variables and constants here, since the discussion is
not specific to @nt<object_declaration>s, and it seems
better to have the list of the kinds of constants juxtaposed
with the kinds of objects.

We no longer talk about indirect updating due to parameter passing.
Parameter passing is handled in 6.2 and 6.4.1 in a way that there
is no need to mention it here in the definition of read and update.
Reading and updating now includes the case of evaluating or
assigning to an enclosing object.

For an @nt<object_declaration> without an initialization expression,

@begin(itemize)
  The implicit initial value for an access subtype is the

  @ChgAdded{Version=[3],Text=[The implicit initial value for a scalar subtype

  The implicit initial (and only) value for each discriminant

  @ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0228-1]}

  For a protected or task subtype, there is an implicit component
  (an entry queue) corresponding to each entry, with its implicit

@begin(ImplNote)
    The implementation may add implicit components for its own use,
    which might have implicit initial values.
    For a task subtype, such components might represent the state
    of the associated thread of control. For a type with dynamic-sized
    components, such implicit components might be used to hold the offset to
    some explicit component.

  @begin(Discussion)
    For a per-object constraint that contains some per-object
    expressions and some non-per-object expressions,
    the values used for the constraint consist of the values
    of the non-per-object expressions evaluated at the point
    of the @nt{type_declaration}, and the values of the per-object
    expressions evaluated at the point of the creation of the
    object.

    The elaboration of per-object constraints was presumably performed
    as part of the dependent compatibility check in Ada 83.
    If the object is of a limited type
    with an access discriminant, the @nt<access_definition> is elaborated
    at this time (see @RefSecNum(Discriminants)).
  @end(Discussion)
  @begin{Reason}
    The reason we say that evaluating an explicit initialization
    expression happens before creating the object is that in some cases
    it is impossible to know the size of the object being created until
    its initial value is known, as in
    @lquotes@;X: String := Func_Call(...);@rquotes@;.
    The implementation can create the object early in the
    common case where the size can be known early,

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The syntax rule for @nt{object_declaration} is modified to allow the
@key{aliased} reserved word.

A variable declared by an @nt<object_declaration> can be constrained
by its initial value; that is, a variable of a nominally unconstrained
array subtype, or discriminated type without defaults, can
be declared so long as it has an explicit initial value.
In Ada 83, this was permitted for constants, and for variables
created by allocators, but not for variables declared by
@nt<object_declaration>s. This is particularly important
for tagged class-wide types, since there is no way to constrain
them explicitly, and so an initial value is the only way
to provide a constraint. It is also important for generic formal
private types with unknown discriminants.

We now allow an @nt{unconstrained_array_definition}
in an @nt{object_declaration}.
This allows an object of an anonymous array type to have its
bounds determined by its initial value.
This is for uniformity: If one can write @lquotes@;X: @key[constant]
@key[array](Integer @key[range] 1..10) @key[of] Integer := ...;@rquotes@; then
it makes sense to also allow
@lquotes@;X: @key[constant] @key[array](Integer @key[range] <>) @key[of] Integer := ...;@rquotes@;.
(Note that if anonymous array types are
ever sensible, a common situation is for a table implemented as an array.
Tables are often constant, and for constants, there's usually no point in
forcing the user to count the number of elements in the value.)
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
We have moved the syntax for @nt{object_declaration}s into this subclause.

Deferred constants no longer have a separate syntax rule, but rather
are incorporated in @nt<object_declaration> as constants declared
without an initialization expression.

If the parent type is an elementary type or an array type, then the

For a scalar type, the base range of the derived type is the same
as that of the parent type.
@begin{Discussion}

  or a @nt<real_type_definition> is determined by the @ntf<_definition>,
  and is not necessarily the same as that of the corresponding
  root numeric type from which the newly defined type is implicitly
  derived. Treating numerics types as implicitly derived from one of
  the two root numeric types is simply to link them into a type hierarchy;
  such an implicit derivation does not follow all the rules given here
  for an explicit @nt<derived_type_definition>.

@Redundant[For each predefined operator of the parent type,

  @RefSecNum(Operators and Expression Evaluation), is determined by
  the classes to which it belongs.
@end(TheProof)
@begin(Reason)
  Predefined operators are handled separately because
  they follow a slightly different rule
  than user-defined primitive subprograms. In particular
  the systematic replacement described below does not apply fully to the
  relational operators for Boolean and the exponentiation
  operator for Integer. The relational operators for a type
  derived from Boolean still return Standard.Boolean. The
  exponentiation operator for a type derived from Integer
  still expects Standard.Integer for the right operand.
  In addition, predefined operators "reemerge" when a type
  is the actual type corresponding to a generic formal type,
  so they need to be well defined even if hidden by user-defined
  primitive subprograms.

@Defn2{Term=[equality operator],Sec=(special inheritance rule for tagged types)}
Primitive user-defined equality operators of the parent
type@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ and any progenitor types],Old=[]} are also
inherited by the derived type, except when
the derived type is a nonlimited record extension, and
the inherited operator would have a profile that is type
conformant with the profile of the corresponding
predefined equality operator; in this case, the user-defined
equality operator is not inherited, but is rather incorporated into
the implementation of the predefined equality operator of the record extension
(see @RefSecNum(Relational Operators and Membership Tests)).

@begin{Ramification}
  We say @lquotes@;...already exists...@rquotes@; rather than @lquotes@;is visible@rquotes@; or @lquotes@;has

  These cases are explained in @RefSecNum{Private Operations}.

  Note that nonprivate extensions can appear only after the last
  primitive subprogram of the parent @em the freezing rules ensure this.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Reason}
  A special case is made for the equality operators on nonlimited
  record extensions
  because their predefined equality operators are already defined in terms
  of the primitive equality operator of their parent type (and of the
  tagged components of the extension part). Inheriting the parent's
  equality operator as is would be undesirable, because it would ignore
  any components of the extension part.
  On the other hand, if the parent type is limited, then any user-defined
  equality operator is inherited as is, since there is no predefined
  equality operator to take its place.

@begin{Notes}
@Defn{closed under derivation}
Classes are closed under derivation @em
any class that contains a type also contains its derivatives.
Operations available for a given class of types
are available for the derived types in that class.

Evaluating an inherited enumeration literal
is equivalent to evaluating the corresponding enumeration literal
of the parent type, and then converting the result to
the derived type. This follows from their equivalence to
parameterless functions.
@PDefn2{Term=[implicit subtype conversion],Sec=(inherited enumeration literal)}

A generic subprogram is not a subprogram,
and hence cannot be a primitive subprogram and
cannot be inherited by a derived type. On the other hand,
an instance of a generic subprogram can be a primitive subprogram,
and hence can be inherited.

If the parent type is an access type, then the parent
and the derived type share the same storage pool;
there is a @key{null} access value for the derived type
and it is the implicit initial value for the type.
See @RefSecNum(Access Types).

If the parent type is a boolean type, the predefined relational operators
of the derived type deliver a result of the predefined type Boolean
(see @RefSecNum(Relational Operators and Membership Tests)).
If the parent type is an integer type, the right operand of the
predefined exponentiation operator is of the predefined type Integer
(see @RefSecNum(Highest Precedence Operators)).

Any discriminants of the parent type are either all inherited, or
completely replaced with a new set of discriminants.

For an inherited subprogram, the subtype of a formal parameter
of the derived type need not have any value in common with the first
subtype of the derived type.
@begin(TheProof)
  @Leading@;This happens when the parent subtype is constrained to a range
  that does not overlap with the range of a subtype of the parent
  type that appears in the profile of
  some primitive subprogram of the parent type.
  For example:
@begin(example)
@key(type) T1 @key(is range) 1..100;
@key(subtype) S1 @key(is) T1 @key(range) 1..10;
@key(procedure) P(X : @key[in] S1);  @RI{-- P is a primitive subprogram}
@key(type) T2 @key(is new) T1 @key(range) 11..20;

@RI{--      X cannot be in T2'First .. T2'Last}

type, the type is abstract (see @RefSecNum{Abstract Types and Subprograms}).

@lquotes@;class-wide@rquotes@; because when a formal parameter is defined
to be of a class-wide type @i(T)'Class, an actual parameter
of any type in the derivation class rooted at @i(T) is acceptable
(see @RefSecNum(The Context of Overload Resolution)).

@NoPrefix@Defn{first subtype}
The set of values for a class-wide type @i(T)'Class is the discriminated
union of the set of values of each specific type in the
derivation class rooted at @i(T) (the tag acts as the implicit discriminant
@em see @RefSecNum(Tagged Types and Type Extensions)).
Class-wide types have no primitive subprograms of their own.
However, as explained in @RefSecNum(Dispatching Operations of Tagged Types),
operands of a class-wide type @i(T)'Class can be used as part
of a dispatching call on a primitive subprogram of the type @i(T).
The only components @Redundant[(including discriminants)] of
@i(T)'Class that are visible are those of @i(T).
If S is a first subtype,
then S'Class is a first subtype.

These are analogous to class-wide types for these language-defined
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[elementary],Old=[numeric]} classes.
As with class-wide types, if a formal parameter is of a universal type,
then an actual parameter of any type in the corresponding class
is acceptable. In addition, a value of a universal type
(including an integer or real @nt<numeric_literal>@Chg{Version=[2],New=[, or
the literal @key{null}],Old=[]}) is @lquotes@;universal@rquotes@;
in that it is acceptable where some particular type in the
class is expected
(see @RefSecNum(The Context of Overload Resolution)).

@NoPrefix@;The set of values of a universal type is the undiscriminated union
of the set of values possible for any definable type in the associated class.
Like class-wide types, universal types have no
primitive subprograms of their own. However, their @lquotes@;universality@rquotes@; allows
them to be used as operands with the primitive subprograms of any

@begin(Discussion)
  A class-wide type is only class-wide in one direction,
  from specific to class-wide, whereas
  a universal type is class-wide (universal) in both directions,
  from specific to universal and back.

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00230-01]}
  We considered defining class-wide or perhaps universal types for
  all derivation classes, not just tagged classes and these @Chg{Version=[2],
  New=[four elementary],Old=[three numeric]} classes. However, this was felt
  to overly weaken the strong-typing model in some situations. Tagged types
  preserve strong type distinctions thanks to the run-time tag. Class-wide
  or universal types for untagged types would weaken the compile-time
  type distinctions without providing a compensating run-time-checkable
  distinction.

  We considered defining standard names for the universal
  numeric types so they could be used in formal parameter specifications.
  However, this was felt to impose an undue implementation burden for
  some implementations.
@end(Discussion)
@begin(Honest)
  Formally, the set of values of a universal type is actually a @i(copy) of
  the undiscriminated union of the values of the types in its
  class. This is because we
  want each value to have exactly one type, with explicit or implicit
  conversion needed to go between types. An alternative,
  consistent model would be to associate a class, rather than
  a particular type, with a value,
  even though any given expression would have a particular type.
  In that case, implicit type conversions would not generally need to
  change the value, although an associated subtype conversion might
  need to.

@begin{Notes}
Because operands of a universal type are acceptable to the
predefined operators of any type in their class, ambiguity can
result. For @i(universal_integer) and @i(universal_real), this
potential ambiguity is resolved by giving a preference
(see @RefSecNum{The Context of Overload Resolution})
to the predefined operators
of the corresponding root types (@i(root_integer)
and @i(root_real), respectively).
Hence, in an apparently ambiguous expression like
@begin(Display)
1 + 4 < 7
@end(Display)

@NoPrefix@;where each of the literals is of type @i(universal_integer),
the predefined operators of @i(root_integer) will be preferred over those
of other specific integer types, thereby resolving the ambiguity.
@begin(Ramification)

  is essentially like any other specific type in the

  We say "the expected type is ..." or "the type is expected to be ..."
  depending on which reads better. They are fundamentally equivalent,
  and both feed into the type resolution rules of @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]}
  @RefSecNum(The Context of Overload Resolution).

  In some cases, it doesn't work to use expected types.
  For example, in the above rule, we say that
  the @lquotes@;type of the @nt<range> shall resolve to ...@rquotes@;
  rather than @lquotes@;the expected type for the @nt<range> is ...@rquotes@;.
  We then use @lquotes@;expected type@rquotes@; for the bounds.
  If we used @lquotes@;expected@rquotes@; at both points, there
  would be an ambiguity, since one could apply the rules of
  @RefSecNum{The Context of Overload Resolution}
  either on determining the type of the range, or on determining the
  types of the individual bounds. It is clearly important
  to allow one bound to be of a universal type, and the other of
  a specific type, so we need to use @lquotes@;expected type@rquotes@; for the bounds.
  Hence, we used @lquotes@;shall resolve to@rquotes@; for the type of the range as a
  whole.
  There are other situations where @lquotes@;expected type@rquotes@; is not quite
  right, and we use @lquotes@;shall resolve to@rquotes@; instead.

@begin(Discussion)
  This paragraph addresses an issue that came up with Ada 83,
  where for fixed point types, the end points of the range
  specified in the type definition were not necessarily within
  the base range of the type. However, it was later clarified (and
  we reconfirm it in @RefSec(Fixed Point Types)) that the First and
  Last attributes reflect the true bounds chosen for the type, not the
  bounds specified in the type definition (which might be outside
  the ultimately chosen base range).
@end(Discussion)

For a subtype of a scalar type, the result delivered by the attributes
Succ, Pred, and Value might not belong to the subtype; similarly,
the actual parameters
of the attributes Succ, Pred, and Image need not belong to the subtype.

@Defn{incompatibilities with Ada 83}
S'Base is no longer defined for nonscalar types.
One conceivable existing use of S'Base for nonscalar types is
S'Base'Size where S is a generic formal private type.
However, that is not generally useful because the actual
subtype corresponding to S might be a constrained array
or discriminated type, which would mean that S'Base'Size might
very well overflow (for example, S'Base'Size where S is
a constrained subtype of String will generally be 8 * (Integer'Last + 1)).
For derived discriminated types that are packed, S'Base'Size might not even
be well defined if the first subtype is constrained, thereby allowing
some amount of normally required @lquotes@;dope@rquotes@; to have been squeezed out
in the packing. Hence our conclusion is that S'Base'Size is
not generally useful in a generic, and does not justify keeping
the attribute Base for nonscalar types just so it can be used
as a @Chg{New=[@nt{prefix}],Old=[prefix]}.

Each enumeration literal corresponds to a distinct value

The position number of the value of

A @nt<modular_type_definition> defines a modular type whose base range
is from zero to one less than the given modulus.
@Defn2{Term=[constrained], Sec=(subtype)}
@Defn2{Term=[unconstrained], Sec=(subtype)}
A @nt<modular_type_definition> also defines a constrained first
subtype of the type with a range that is the same as the base range of
the type.

@Defn{Integer}
There is a predefined signed integer subtype named
Integer@Redundant[,
declared in the visible part of
package Standard].
It is constrained to the base range of its type.
@begin{Reason}
  Integer is a constrained subtype, rather than an unconstrained
  subtype. This means that on assignment to an object of subtype Integer,
  a range check is required. On the other hand, an object of subtype
  Integer'Base is unconstrained, and no range check (only overflow check)
  is required on assignment. For example, if the object is held in an
  extended-length register, its value might be outside of
  Integer'First .. Integer'Last. All parameter and result subtypes
  of the predefined integer operators are of such unconstrained subtypes,
  allowing extended-length registers to be used as operands or
  for the result.
  In an earlier version of Ada 95, Integer was unconstrained. However,
  the fact that certain Constraint_Errors might be omitted or appear
  elsewhere was felt to be an undesirable upward inconsistency in this case.
  Note that for Float, the opposite conclusion was reached, partly because
  of the high cost of performing range checks when not actually necessary.
  Objects of subtype Float are unconstrained, and no range checks, only
  overflow checks, are performed for them.
@end{Reason}

@Leading@Defn{Natural}
@Defn{Positive}
Integer has two predefined subtypes,
@Redundant[declared in the visible part of package Standard:]
@begin{Example}
@key[subtype] Natural  @key[is] Integer @key[range] 0 .. Integer'Last;
@key[subtype] Positive @key[is] Integer @key[range] 1 .. Integer'Last;
@end{Example}

@Defn{root_integer}
@Defn{Min_Int}
@Defn{Max_Int}
A type defined by an @nt<integer_type_definition> is implicitly
derived from @i(root_integer), an anonymous
predefined (specific) integer type, whose base
range is System.Min_Int .. System.Max_Int.
However, the base range of the new type is not inherited from
@i{root_integer}, but is instead determined by the range or modulus
specified by the @nt{integer_type_definition}.
@PDefn{universal_integer}
@Defn{integer literals}
@Redundant[Integer literals are all of the type @i(universal_integer),
the universal type (see @RefSecNum(Derivation Classes)) for the

the operations of any integer type.]
@begin{Discussion}
  This implicit derivation is not considered exactly equivalent to
  explicit derivation via a @nt<derived_type_definition>. In particular,
  integer types defined via a @nt<derived_type_definition> inherit their
  base range from their parent type. A type defined by
  an @nt<integer_type_definition> does not necessarily inherit
  its base range from @i(root_integer).
  It is not specified whether the implicit derivation from
  @i(root_integer) is direct or indirect, not that it really matters.
  All we want is for all integer types to be descendants of @i(root_integer).

Long_Integer, Short_Short_Integer, Long_Long_Integer, etc.
Different predefined integer types are allowed to have the same base range.
However, the range of Integer should be no wider than that of Long_Integer.
Similarly, the range of Short_Integer (if provided) should be no wider
than Integer.
Corresponding recommendations apply to any other predefined integer types.
There need not be a named integer type corresponding to each
distinct base range supported by an implementation.
The range of each first subtype should be the base range of its type.
@ImplDef{The predefined integer types declared in Standard.}

@Defn{nonstandard integer type}
An implementation may provide @i(nonstandard integer types),
descendants of @i(root_integer) that are
declared outside of the specification of package Standard,
which need not have all the standard characteristics
of a type defined by an @nt<integer_type_definition>.
For example, a nonstandard integer type
might have an asymmetric base range
or it might not be allowed as
an array or loop index (a very long integer).
Any type descended from a nonstandard integer type is also nonstandard.
An implementation may place arbitrary restrictions on the use of such types;
it is implementation defined whether operators that are predefined
for @lquotes@;any integer type@rquotes@; are defined for a particular
nonstandard integer type.

Text=[Long_Integer should be declared in Standard if the target supports

@begin{ImplNote}
To promote portability, implementations should explicitly declare the integer
(sub)types Integer and Long_Integer in Standard, and leave other
predefined integer types anonymous.
For implementations
that already support Byte_Integer, etc., upward compatibility
argues for keeping such declarations in Standard during the
transition period, but perhaps generating a warning on use.
A separate package Interfaces in the predefined environment
is available for pre-declaring types such as Integer_8, Integer_16, etc.
See @RefSecNum(The Package Interfaces).
In any case, if the user declares a subtype (first or not)
whose range fits in, for example, a byte, the implementation can
store variables of the subtype in a single byte, even if the
base range of the type is wider.
@end{ImplNote}

@PDefn2{Term=[two's complement],Sec=(modular types)}

@begin{Notes}
@PDefn{universal_integer}
@Defn{integer literals}
Integer literals are of the anonymous predefined
integer type @i(universal_integer). Other integer types
have no literals. However, the overload resolution rules
(see @RefSec(The Context of Overload Resolution))
allow expressions of the type @i(universal_integer)
whenever an integer type is expected.

The same arithmetic operators are predefined for all signed integer types
defined by a @nt<signed_integer_type_definition>
(see @RefSec(Operators and Expression Evaluation)).
For modular types, these same operators are predefined, plus
bit-wise logical operators (@key(and), @key(or), @key(xor), and @key(not)).
In addition, for the unsigned types declared in the language-defined
package Interfaces (see @RefSecNum(The Package Interfaces)),
functions are defined that provide
bit-wise shifting and rotating.

Modular types match a @nt{generic_formal_parameter_declaration} of the
form "@key(type) T @key(is mod) <>;";
signed integer types match "@key(type) T @key(is range) <>;"
(see @RefSecNum{Formal Scalar Types}).

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
An implementation is allowed to support any number of distinct
base ranges for integer types, even if fewer
integer types are explicitly declared in Standard.

Modular (unsigned, wrap-around) types are new.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
Ada 83's integer types are now called "signed" integer types,
to contrast them with "modular" integer types.

Standard.Integer, Standard.Long_Integer, etc., denote
constrained subtypes of predefined integer types, consistent
with the Ada 95 model that only subtypes have names.

We now impose minimum requirements on the base range of
Integer and Long_Integer.

We no longer explain integer type definition in terms
of an equivalence to a normal type derivation, except to say that all
integer types are by definition implicitly derived from @i(root_integer).
This is for various reasons.

First of all, the equivalence with a type derivation and a subtype
declaration was not perfect, and was the source of various AIs (for example,
is the conversion of the bounds static? Is a numeric type a derived
type with respect to other rules of the language?)

Secondly, we don't want to require that every integer size supported
shall have a corresponding named type in Standard. Adding named
types to Standard creates nonportabilities.

Thirdly, we don't want the set of types that match
a formal derived type "type T is new Integer;" to
depend on the particular underlying integer representation chosen
to implement a given user-defined integer type. Hence, we
would have needed anonymous integer types as parent types for
the implicit derivation anyway. We have simply chosen to identify
only one anonymous integer type @em @i(root_integer), and stated
that every integer type is derived from it.

Finally, the @lquotes@;fiction@rquotes@; that there were distinct
preexisting predefined types
for every supported representation breaks down for fixed point
with arbitrary smalls, and was never exploited for enumeration
types, array types, etc. Hence, there seems little benefit
to pushing an explicit equivalence between integer type
definition and normal type derivation.

@begin{Inconsistent83}
@Defn{inconsistencies with Ada 83}
No Range_Checks, only Overflow_Checks, are performed on
variables (or parameters) of an
unconstrained floating point subtype. This is upward
compatible for programs that do not raise Constraint_Error.
For those that do raise Constraint_Error, it is possible
that the exception will be raised at a later point, or
not at all, if extended range floating point registers are used to hold
the value of the variable (or parameter).
@begin(Reason)
  This change was felt to be justified by the possibility
  of improved performance on machines with extended-range
  floating point registers. An implementation need not
  take advantage of this relaxation in the range checking; it
  can hide completely the use of extended range registers if desired,
  presumably at some run-time expense.

Discussion of model numbers is postponed to

The concept of safe numbers has been replaced by the concept
of the safe range of values. The bounds of the safe range are

T'Safe_Large, since on some machines the safe range is not
perfectly symmetric.
The concept of machine numbers is new, and is relevant to

or implicitly) a range that is compatible with the subtype.
@begin(Discussion)
  Except for the requirement that the @i(digits) specified be
  no greater than the @i(digits) of the subtype being
  constrained, a @nt<digits_constraint> is essentially
  equivalent to a @nt<range_constraint>.

  @Leading@keepnext@;Consider the following example:
@begin{Example}
@key[type] D @key[is] @key[delta] 0.01 @key[digits] 7 @key[range] -0.00 .. 9999.99;
@end{Example}

  @ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{Presentation AI-00008}
  The compatibility rule implies that the @nt{digits_constraint}
  "@key[digits] 6" specifies an implicit range of
  "@en@;@Chg{New=[9999.99],Old=[99.9999]} .. @Chg{New=[9999.99],Old=[99.9999]}".
  Thus, "@key[digits] 6" is not compatible with the constraint of D, but
  "@key[digits] 6 range 0.00 .. 9999.99" is compatible.

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
  A value of a scalar type
  belongs to a constrained subtype of the type if it belongs to the
  range of the subtype. Attributes like Digits and Delta have no
  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[effect],Old=[affect]} on this fundamental rule.
  So the obsolescent forms of
  @nt<digits_constraint>s and @nt<delta_constraint>s that are
  called @lquotes@;accuracy constraints@rquotes@; in RM83 don't really
  represent constraints on the values of the subtype, but rather primarily
  affect compatibility of the @lquotes@;constraint@rquotes@; with the subtype
  being @lquotes@;constrained.@rquotes@; In this sense, they might better
  be called @lquotes@;subtype assertions@rquotes@; rather than @lquotes@;constraints.@rquotes@;

  Note that the @nt<digits_constraint> on a decimal fixed point subtype
  is a combination of an assertion about the @i(digits) of the
  subtype being further constrained, and a constraint on the range of
  the subtype being defined, either explicit or implicit.
@end(Discussion)

@ChgRef{Version=[4],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI12-0152-1]}
@PDefn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(digits_constraint)}
The elaboration of a @nt<digits_constraint> consists of the
elaboration of the @nt<range_constraint>, if any.
@IndexCheck{Range_Check}
If a @nt<range_constraint> is given, a check is made that
the bounds of the range are both in the range
@en@;(10**@i(D)@en@;1)*@i(delta) .. +(10**@i(D)@en@;1)*@i(delta),
where @i(D) is the value of the (static)
@Chg{Version=[4],New=[@nt<simple_expression>],Old=[@nt<expression>]}
given after the reserved word @key(digits).
@Defn2{Term=(Constraint_Error),Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
If this check fails, Constraint_Error is raised.
@end{RunTime}

@begin{ImplReq}
The implementation shall support at least 24 bits of precision
(including the sign bit) for fixed point types.
@begin{Reason}
This is sufficient to represent Standard.Duration with a @i(small)
no more than 50 milliseconds.
@end{Reason}
@end{ImplReq}

@begin{ImplPerm}
Implementations are permitted to support only
@i(small)s that are a power of two. In particular,
all decimal fixed point type declarations can be disallowed.
Note however that conformance with the Information Systems Annex
requires support for decimal @i(small)s, and decimal fixed point
type declarations with @i(digits) up to at least 18.
@begin{ImplNote}
The accuracy requirements for multiplication, division, and conversion
(see @RefSec{Model of Floating Point Arithmetic})
are such that
support for arbitrary @i(small)s should be practical without undue
implementation effort. Therefore, implementations should support fixed point
types with arbitrary values for @i(small) (within reason).
One reasonable limitation would be to limit support to fixed point types
that can be converted to the most precise floating point type
without loss of precision (so that Fixed_IO is implementable in terms
of Float_IO).
@end{ImplNote}
@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{Notes}
  @Leading@;The base range of
  an ordinary fixed point type need not include the specified bounds
  themselves
  so that the range specification can be given in a natural way, such as:
  @leading@begin(Example)
   @b(type) Fraction @b(is delta) 2.0**(-15) @b(range) -1.0 .. 1.0;
  @end(Example)

  @NoPrefix@;With 2's complement hardware, such a type could have a
  signed 16-bit representation, using 1 bit for the sign
  and 15 bits for fraction, resulting in a base range of
  @en@;1.0 .. 1.0@en@;2.0**(@en@;15).
@end{Notes}

@begin{Inconsistent83}
@Defn{inconsistencies with Ada 83}
In Ada 95, S'Small always equals S'Base'Small,
so if an implementation chooses a @i(small) for a fixed point type smaller
than required by the @i(delta), the value of S'Small in Ada 95 might not be
the same as it was in Ada 83.

capabilities are essentially similar to that available
in Ada 83 with a fixed point type whose @i(small) equals its @i(delta)
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[and both are],Old=[equals]}
a power of 10. However, in the Information Systems Annex, additional
requirements are placed on the support of decimal fixed point types
(e.g. a minimum of 18 digits of precision).

@begin{DiffWord83}
The syntax rules for @ntf{fixed_point_constraint} and
@ntf{fixed_accuracy_definition} are removed. The syntax rule for

@Defn2{Term=[digits], Sec=(of a decimal fixed point subtype)}
@begin(itemize)
  For a first subtype or a subtype

  For a subtype defined by a @nt<subtype_indication> without

@begin(ImplNote)
  Although a decimal subtype can be both range-constrained
  and digits-constrained, the digits constraint is intended
  to control the Size attribute of the subtype. For decimal
  types, Size can be important because input/output of decimal types

@begin{Notes}
All subtypes of a fixed point type will have the same value

S'Scale is not always the same as S'Aft for a decimal subtype;

S'Aft is 1 while S'Scale is 0.

@PDefn2{Term=[predefined operations],Sec=(of a fixed point type)}
The predefined operations of a fixed point type include the assignment
operation, qualification, the membership tests, and
explicit conversion to and from other numeric types. They also
include the relational operators and the following predefined
arithmetic operators:
the binary and unary adding operators @en@; and +, multiplying
operators, and the unary operator @key(abs).

As for all types, objects of a fixed point type
have Size and Address attributes
(see @RefSecNum(Operational and Representation Attributes)).
Other attributes of fixed point types are defined in
