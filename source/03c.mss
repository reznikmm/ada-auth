@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00251-01]}
The intended implementation model is for @Chg{Version=[2],New=[the static
portion of ],Old=[]}a tag to be represented as a
pointer to a statically allocated and link-time initialized type
descriptor. The type descriptor contains the address of the code for
each primitive operation of the type. It probably also contains
other information, such as might make membership tests convenient and
efficient.@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ Tags for nested type extensions must also have
a dynamic part that identifies the particular elaboration of the type.],Old=[]}

The primitive operations of a tagged type are known at its first
freezing point; the type descriptor is laid out at that point.
It contains linker symbols for each primitive operation; the linker
fills in the actual addresses.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI95-00251-01]}
@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[Primitive operations of type extensions that are
declared at a level deeper than the level of the ultimate ancestor from which
they are derived can
be represented by wrappers that use the dynamic part of the tag to call the
actual primitive operation. The dynamic part would generally be some way to
represent the static link or display necessary for making a nested call. One
implementation strategy would be to store that information in the extension
part of such nested type extensions, and use the dynamic part of the tag to
point at it. (That way, the @lquotes@;dynamic@rquotes@; part of the tag could
be static, at the cost of indirect access.)]}

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI95-00251-01]}
@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[If the tagged type is descended from any interface
types, it also will need to include @lquotes@;subtags@rquotes@; (one for
each interface) that describe the mapping of the primitive operations of the
interface to the primitives of the type. These subtags could directly reference
the primitive operations (for faster performance), or simply provide the tag
@lquotes@;slot@rquotes@; numbers for the primitive operations (for easier
derivation). In either case, the subtags would be used for calls that dispatch
through a class-wide type of the interface.]}

Other implementation models are possible.

The rules ensure that @lquotes@;dangling dispatching@rquotes@; is impossible;
that is, when a dispatching call is made, there is always a body to
execute. This is different from some other object-oriented
languages, such as Smalltalk, where it is possible to get a run-time
error from a missing method.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00251-01]}
Dispatching calls should be efficient, and should have a bounded
worst-case execution time. This is important in a language intended
for real-time applications. In the intended implementation model, a
dispatching call involves calling indirect through the appropriate
slot in the dispatch table. No complicated "method lookup" is
involved@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ although a call which is dispatching on
an interface may require a lookup of the appropriate interface subtag],Old=[]}.

The programmer should have the choice at each call site of a
dispatching operation whether to do a dispatching call or a
statically determined call (i.e. whether the body executed should be
determined at run time or at compile time).

The same body should be executed for a call where the tag is
statically determined to be T'Tag as for a dispatching call where the
tag is found at run time to be T'Tag. This allows one to test a
given tagged type with statically determined calls, with some
confidence that run-time dispatching will produce the same behavior.

All views of a type should share the same type descriptor and the
same tag.

The visibility rules determine what is legal at compile time; they
have nothing to do with what bodies can be executed at run time.
Thus, it is possible to dispatch to a subprogram whose declaration is
not visible at the call site. In fact, this is one of the primary
facts that gives object-oriented programming its power. The
subprogram that ends up being dispatched to by a given call might
even be designed long after the call site has been coded and
compiled.

Given that Ada has overloading, determining whether a given
subprogram overrides another is based both on the names and the type
profiles of the operations.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00401-01]}
When a type extension is declared, if there is any place within its
immediate scope where a certain subprogram of the parent
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[or progenitor ],Old=[]}is visible,
then a matching subprogram should override. If there is no such
place, then a matching subprogram should be totally unrelated, and
occupy a different slot in the type descriptor. This is important to
preserve the privacy of private parts; when an operation declared in
a private part is inherited, the inherited version can be overridden
only in that private part, in the package body, and in any children
of the package.

If an implementation shares code for instances
of generic bodies, it should be
allowed to share type descriptors of tagged types
declared in the generic body, so long as they are not extensions of types
declared in the specification of the generic unit.

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Added],ARef=[AI95-00344-01]}
  @ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[In most cases, a tag need only identify a particular
    tagged type declaration, and can therefore be a simple link-time-known
    address. However, for tag checks
    (see @RefSecNum{Dispatching Operations of Tagged Types}) it is essential
    that each descendant (that currently exists) of a given type have
    a unique tag. Hence, for types declared in shared generic bodies
    where an ancestor comes from outside the generic, or for types
    declared at a deeper level than an ancestor, the tag needs to be
    augmented with some kind of dynamic descriptor (which may be a
    static link, global display, instance descriptor pointer, or combination).
    This implies that type Tag may need to be two words, the second of which
    is normally null, but in these identified special cases needs to
    include a static link or equivalent. Within an object of one of
    these types with a two-word tag, the two parts of the tag would
    typically be separated, one part as the first word of the object,
    the second placed in the first extension part that corresponds to a
    type declared more nested than its parent or declared in a shared
    generic body when the parent is declared outside. Alternatively,
    by using an extra level of indirection, the type Tag could remain
    a single-word.]}

    basis, which in some implementation models implies per-elaboration of the

@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[Ada 95 allowed Tag_Error in this case, or expected
the functions to work. This worked because most implementations used tags
constructed at link-time, and each elaboration of the same @nt{type_declaration}
produced the same tag. However, Ada 2005 requires at least part of the tags
to be dynamically constructed for a type derived from a type at a shallower
level. For dynamically constructed tags, detecting the error can be expensive
and unreliable. To see
this, consider a program containing two tasks. Task A creates a nested tagged
type, passes the tag to task B (which saves it), and then terminates. The
nested tag (if dynamic) probably will need to refer in some way to the stack
frame for task A.
If task B later tries to use the tag created by task A, the tag's reference to
the stack frame of A probably is a dangling pointer. Avoiding this would
require some sort of protected tag manager, which would be a bottleneck in a
program's performance. Moreover, we'd still have a race condition; if task A
terminated after the tag check, but before the tag was used, we'd still have
a problem. That means that all of these operations would have to be serialized.
That could be a significant performance drain, whether or not nested tagged
types are ever used. Therefore, we allow execution to become erroneous
as we do for other dangling pointers. If the implementation can detect the
error, we recommend that Tag_Error be raised.]}

@begin{Notes}
A type declared with the reserved word @key[tagged]

so that new primitive subprograms can be declared for it.

Once an object has been created,
its tag never changes.

Class-wide types are defined to have unknown discriminants
(see @RefSecNum(Discriminants)). This means that objects of a class-wide
type have to be explicitly initialized (whether created by
an @nt<object_declaration> or an @nt<allocator>),
and that @nt<aggregate>s have to be explicitly qualified with a specific
type when their expected type is class-wide.

type could be passed to a dispatching operation of a nonlimited ancestor
type. That operation could try to copy the object with the task component.

If TT were declared as abstract, then we could have the same
problem with abstract procedures.

This rule is needed
because (1) we don't want people dispatching to things that haven't
been declared yet, and (2) we want to allow @Chg{Version=[2],New=[the static
part of ],Old=[]}tagged type descriptors
to be static (allocated statically, and initialized to link-time-known
symbols). Suppose T2 inherits primitive P from T1, and then
overrides P. Suppose P is called @i{before} the declaration of the
overriding P. What should it dispatch to? If the answer is the new
P, we've violated the first principle above. If the answer is the
old P, we've violated the second principle. (A call
to the new one necessarily raises Program_Error, but that's
beside the point.)

Note that a call upon a dispatching operation of type @i(T) will freeze @i(T).

We considered applying this rule to all derived types,
for uniformity.
However, that would be upward incompatible,
so we rejected the idea.
As in Ada 83, for an untagged type, the above call upon P will call the
old P (which is arguably confusing).

@begin{RunTime}
@Leading@PDefn2{Term=[execution], Sec=(call on a dispatching operation)}
@Defn{controlling tag value}
For the execution of a call on a dispatching operation of a type @i(T),
the @i(controlling tag value) determines
which subprogram body is executed.
The controlling tag value is defined as follows:
@begin(itemize)
  @PDefn{statically determined tag}
  If one or more controlling operands are statically tagged, then
  the controlling tag value is @i(statically determined) to be the tag
  of @i(T).

  If one or more controlling operands are dynamically tagged, then
  the controlling tag value is not statically determined, but is
  rather determined by
  the tags of the controlling operands.
  @IndexCheck{Tag_Check}
  If there is more than one dynamically tagged controlling operand,
  a check is made that they all have the same tag.
  @Defn2{Term=(Constraint_Error),Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
  If this check fails, Constraint_Error is raised
  unless the call is a @nt<function_call> whose @nt<name> denotes
  the declaration of an equality operator (predefined or user defined) that
  returns Boolean,
  in which case the result of the call is defined to indicate
  inequality, and no @nt<subprogram_body> is executed.
  This check is performed prior to evaluating any tag-indeterminate
  controlling operands.
  @begin(Reason)
    Tag mismatch is considered an error (except for "=" and "/=")
    since the corresponding primitive
    subprograms in each specific type expect all controlling
    operands to be of the same type.
    For tag mismatch with an equality operator, rather than raising
    an exception, "=" returns False and "/=" returns True.
    No equality operator is actually invoked, since there
    is no common tag value to control the dispatch.
    Equality is a special case to be consistent with the existing
    Ada 83 principle that equality comparisons, even
    between objects with different constraints, never raise Constraint_Error.

@begin{Reason}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0005-1]}
@Leading@;The wording of the above @Chg{Version=[3],New=[rules],Old=[rule]}
is intended to ensure that the same body is executed for a given tag,
whether that tag is determined statically or dynamically.
For a type declared in a package,
it doesn't matter whether a given subprogram is
overridden in the visible part or the private part,
and it doesn't matter whether the call is inside or outside the package.
For example:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] P1 @key[is]
    @key[type] T1 @key[is] @key[tagged] @key[null] @key[record];
    @key[procedure] Op_A(Arg : @key[in] T1);
    @key[procedure] Op_B(Arg : @key[in] T1);
@key[end] P1;

@key[with] P1; @key[use] P1;
@key[package] P2 @key[is]
    @key[type] T2 @key[is] @key[new] T1 @key[with] @key[null] @key[record];
    @key[procedure] Op_A(Param : @key[in] T2);
@key[private]
    @key[procedure] Op_B(Param : @key[in] T2);
@key[end] P2;

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{Presentation AI-00009 & AI-00114}
@key[with] P1; @key[with] P2;
@key[procedure] Main @key[is]
    X : @Chg{New=[P2.],Old=[]}T2;
    Y : @Chg{New=[P1.],Old=[]}T1'Class := X;
@key[begin]
    P2.Op_A(Param => X); --@RI{ Nondispatching call@Chg{New=[ to a dispatching operation],Old=[]}.}
    P1.Op_A(Arg => Y); --@RI{ Dispatching call.}
    P2.Op_B(Arg => X); --@RI{ Nondispatching call@Chg{New=[ to a dispatching operation],Old=[]}.}
    P1.Op_B(Arg => Y); --@RI{ Dispatching call.}
@key[end] Main;
@end{Example}

The two calls to Op_A both execute the body of Op_A that has to occur in
the body of package P2.
Similarly,
the two calls to Op_B both execute the body of Op_B that has to occur in
the body of package P2,
even though Op_B is overridden in the private part of P2.
Note, however, that the formal parameter names are different for P2.Op_A
versus P2.Op_B.
The overriding declaration for P2.Op_B is not visible in Main,
so the name in the call actually denotes the implicit declaration
of Op_B inherited from T1.


If a call occurs in the program text before an overriding,
which can happen only if the call is part of a default expression,
the overriding will still take effect for that call.

@end{Reason}

@begin{ImplNote}
Even when a tag is not @i(statically determined), a compiler
  might still be able to figure it out and thereby avoid
  the overhead of run-time dispatching.
@end{implnote}

@end{RunTime}

@begin{Notes}

The body to be executed for a call on a dispatching operation is
determined by the tag;
it does not matter whether that tag is determined statically or
dynamically,
and it does not matter whether the subprogram's declaration is visible at
the place of the call.


@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00260-02]}
This subclause covers calls on @Chg{Version=[2],New=[dispatching],

Rules for tagged type membership tests are described
in @RefSecNum(Relational Operators and Membership Tests).
Controlling tag determination for an
@nt{assignment_statement}
is described in @RefSecNum(Assignment Statements).

A dispatching call can dispatch to a body whose declaration is
not visible at the place of the call.

A call through an access-to-subprogram value is never
a dispatching call, even if the
access value designates a dispatching operation. Similarly
a call whose @nt<prefix> denotes a @nt<subprogram_renaming_declaration>
cannot be a dispatching call unless the renaming itself is the

An abstract subprogram has no body, so the
rules in this @Chg{Version=[3],New=[subclause],Old=[clause]} are
designed to ensure (at compile time)
that the body will never be invoked.
We do so primarily by disallowing the creation of
values of the abstract type.
Therefore, since type conversion and parameter passing
don't change the tag, we know we will
never get a class-wide value with a tag identifying an abstract type.
This means that we only have to disallow nondispatching calls
on abstract subprograms (dispatching calls will never reach them).

  Untagged types are never abstract,

  Such subprograms cannot be called,
  unless they also happen to be dispatching operations of
  some tagged type, and then only via a dispatching call.

  Class-wide types are never abstract.
  If T is abstract, then it is illegal to declare a stand-alone
  object of type T,
  but it is OK to declare a stand-alone object of type T'Class;
  the latter will get a tag from its initial value,

Similarly, an inherited concrete subprogram can be overridden with an
abstract subprogram.
@end{Ramification}

A class-wide type is never abstract. Even if a class
is rooted at an abstract type, the class-wide type for the
class is not abstract, and an object of the class-wide type
can be created; the tag of such an object will identify
some nonabstract type in the class.
@end{Notes}

@begin{Examples}
@Leading@keepnext@i(Example of an abstract type representing a set of natural numbers:)
@begin{Example}
@key(package) Sets @key(is)
    @key(subtype) Element_Type @key(is) Natural;
    @key(type) Set @key(is abstract tagged null record);
    @key(function) Empty @key(return) Set @key(is abstract);
    @key(function) Union(Left, Right : Set) @key(return) Set @key(is abstract);
    @key(function) Intersection(Left, Right : Set) @key(return) Set @key(is abstract);
    @key(function) Unit_Set(Element : Element_Type) @key(return) Set @key(is abstract);
    @key(procedure) Take(Element : @key(out) Element_Type;
                   From : @key(in out) Set) @key(is abstract);
@key(end) Sets;
@end{Example}
@end{Examples}

@begin{Notes}
@i(Notes on the example:)
Given the above abstract type, one could then derive
various (nonabstract) extensions of the type, representing
alternative implementations of a set. One might use a bit
vector, but impose an upper bound on the largest element representable,
while another might use a hash table, trading off space for flexibility.
@begin{Discussion}
One way to export a type from a package with some components visible
and some components private is as follows:
@begin{Example}
@key[package] P @key[is]
    @key[type] Public_Part @key[is] @key[abstract] @key[tagged]
        @key[record]
            ...
        @key[end] @key[record];
    @key[type] T @key[is] @key[new] Public_Part @key[with] @key[private];
    ...
@key[private]
    @key[type] T @key[is] @key[new] Public_Part @key[with]
        @key[record]
            ...
        @key[end] @key[record];
@key[end] P;
@end{Example}

The fact that Public_Part is abstract tells clients they have to
create objects of type T instead of Public_Part.
Note that the public part has to come first;
it would be illegal to declare a private type Private_Part,
and then a record extension T of it,
unless T were in the private part after the full declaration of Private_Part,
but then clients of the package would not have visibility to T.

@Defn{access type}
@Defn{access value}
@Defn{designate}
A value of an access type (an @i(access value))
provides indirect access to the object or subprogram
it @i(designates). Depending on its type, an access value
can designate either subprograms, objects created by allocators
(see @RefSecNum(Allocators)), or more generally @i(aliased) objects of
an appropriate type.

values designate objects, and @i(access-to-subprogram) types, whose
values designate subprograms.

@Defn{general access type}
Access-to-object types are further subdivided into
@i(pool-specific) access types, whose values can designate only
the elements of their associated storage pool,

@begin(ImplNote)
  The value of an access type will typically be a machine address.

  A formal parameter of a tagged type is defined to be aliased
  so that a (tagged) parameter X may be passed to an access parameter P
  by using P => X'Access. Access parameters are most important
  for tagged types because of dispatching-on-access-parameters
  (see @RefSecNum(Dispatching Operations of Tagged Types)).
  By restricting this to formal parameters, we minimize problems
  associated with allowing components that are not declared aliased
  to be pointed-to from within the same record.

@Leading@;A view conversion of an aliased view is aliased so that
  the type of an access parameter can be changed without
  first converting to a named access type. For example:
@begin{Example}
@key(type) T1 @key(is tagged) ...;
@key(procedure) P(X : @key(access) T1);

@key(type) T2 @key(is new) T1 @key(with) ...;

  With this rule (among others), we ensure that if there might

  @ChgNote{This rule was a disaster, so it thankfully has been repealed.
  We instead make general access constrained subtypes illegal if the type

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{Eilers reported double word}
  We considered making more kinds of objects aliased by default.
  In particular, any object of a by-reference type will pretty
  much have to be allocated at an addressable location,
  so it can be passed by reference without using bit-field
  pointers. Therefore, one might wish to allow the Access and
  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[and ]}Unchecked_Access attributes for such
  objects. However, private parts are transparent to the definition of
  @lquotes@;by-reference type@rquotes@;, so if we made all objects of a by-reference
  type aliased, we would be violating the privacy of private parts.
  Instead, we would have to define a concept of @lquotes@;visibly by-reference@rquotes@;
  and base the rule on that.
  This seemed to complicate the rules more than it was worth,
  especially since there is no way to declare an untagged limited
  private type to be by-reference, since the full type might by
  nonlimited.

@Defn2{Term=[designated type], Sec=(of a named access type)}

If a @nt<general_@!access_@!modifier> appears, then the access type

@Defn{access-to-constant type}
If the modifier is the reserved word @key(constant), then the type is an
@i(access-to-constant type)@Redundant[; a designated object cannot be updated
through a value of such a type].
@Defn{access-to-variable type}
If the modifier is the reserved word @key(all),

can be both read and updated through a value of such a type].
If no @nt<general_@!access_@!modifier> appears in the
@nt<access_to_@!object_@!definition>, the access type is a
pool-specific access-to-variable type.
@begin{Honest}
  The type of the designated subtype is called the
  @i{designated type}.
@end{Honest}
@begin(Reason)
  The modifier @key(all) was picked to suggest that
  values of a general access type could point into @lquotes@;all@rquotes@; storage pools,
  as well as to objects declared aliased, and that @lquotes@;all@rquotes@; access
  (both read and update) to the designated object was provided.
  We couldn't think of any use for pool-specific
  access-to-constant types, so any access type defined with
  the modifier @key(constant) is considered a general access type,
  and can point into any storage pool or at other (appropriate)
  aliased objects.
@end(Reason)
@begin(ImplNote)
  The predefined generic Unchecked_Deallocation can be
  instantiated for any named access-to-variable type. There
  is no (language-defined) support for deallocating objects
  designated by a value of an access-to-constant type. Because of this,
  an allocator for an access-to-constant type can allocate
  out of a storage pool with no support for deallocation.
  Frequently, the allocation can be done at link-time,
  if the size and initial value are known then.
@end(ImplNote)

  For the purpose of generic formal type matching, the relevant

  types, access-to-constant types, and (named) access-to-variable types,
  with its subclass (named) general access-to-variable types.
  Pool-specific access-to-variable types are not a separately matchable

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00254-01]}
  For @Chg{Version=[2],New=[a named],Old=[an]} access-to-subprogram type, the
  representation of an access value might include
  implementation-defined information needed to support
  up-level references @em for example, a static link.
  The accessibility rules (see @RefSecNum(Operations of Access Types)) ensure
  that in a "global-display-based" implementation model (as opposed to
  a static-link-based model), @Chg{Version=[2],New=[a named],Old=[an]}
  access-to-(unprotected)-subprogram value need consist only of the
  address of the subprogram. The global display is guaranteed
  to be properly set up any time the designated subprogram is called.
  Even in a static-link-based model, the only time a static link
  is definitely required is for an access-to-subprogram type declared
  in a scope nested at least two levels deep within subprogram or
  task bodies, since values of such a type might designate subprograms
  nested a smaller number of levels. For the normal case of
  @Chg{Version=[2],New=[a named],Old=[an]} access-to-subprogram type
  declared at the outermost (library) level,
  a code address by itself should be sufficient to represent the
  access value in many implementations.

  For access-to-protected-subprogram, the access values will necessarily
  include both an address (or other identification) of the code of the
  subprogram, as well as the address of the associated protected object.
  This could be thought of as a static link, but it will be needed even
  for global-display-based implementation models. It corresponds
  to the value of the @lquotes@;implicit parameter@rquotes@; that is passed into
  every call of a protected operation, to identify the current instance
  of the protected type on which they are to operate.

  Any Elaboration_Check is performed when a call
  is made through an access value, rather than when the
  access value is first "created" via a 'Access.
  For implementation models that normally put that check at the
  call-site, an access value will have to point to a separate
  entry point that does the check. Alternatively, the
  access value could point to a "subprogram descriptor" that
  consisted of two words (or perhaps more), the first being
  the address of the code, the second being the elaboration bit.
  Or perhaps more efficiently, just the address of the code,
  but using the trick that the descriptor is initialized to
  point to a Raise-Program-Error routine initially, and then
  set to point to the "real" code when the body is elaborated.

  For implementations that share code between generic instantiations,
  the extra level of indirection suggested above to support
  Elaboration_Checks could also be used to provide a pointer to the
  per-instance data area normally required when calling shared code.
  The trick would be to put a pointer to the per-instance data
  area into the subprogram descriptor, and then make sure that
  the address of the subprogram descriptor is loaded into a
  "known" register whenever an indirect call is performed.
  Once inside the shared code, the address of the per-instance
  data area can be retrieved out of the subprogram descriptor,
  by indexing off the "known" register.

@begin{Notes}
Access values are called @lquotes@;pointers@rquotes@; or @lquotes@;references@rquotes@; in

Each access-to-object type has an associated storage pool;
several access types can share the same pool.
An object can be created in the storage pool of an
access type by an @nt{allocator} (see @RefSecNum{Allocators})
for the access type.
A storage pool (roughly) corresponds to what some other languages
call a @lquotes@;heap.@rquotes@;
See @RefSecNum{Storage Management} for a discussion of pools.

Only @nt<index_constraint>s and @nt<discriminant_constraint>s
can be applied to access types
(see @RefSecNum{Index Constraints and Discrete Ranges} and
@RefSecNum{Discriminant Constraints}).

  An incomplete type has no real existence, so it doesn't need to be

@begin{DiffWord83}
@Leading@;Dereferences producing incomplete types
were not explicitly disallowed in RM83, though
AI83-00039 indicated that it was not strictly necessary since
troublesome cases would result in Constraint_Error at run time,
since the access value would necessarily be null.
However, this introduces an undesirable implementation burden,
as illustrated by Example 4 of AI83-00039:
@begin{example}
@key[package] Pack @key[is]
    @key[type] Pri @key[is] @key[private];
@key[private]
    @key[type] Sep;
    @key[type] Pri @key[is] @key[access] Sep;
    X : Pri;
@key[end] Pack;

@key[package] @key[body] Pack @key[is] --@RI{ Could be separately compiled!}
    @key[type] Sep @key[is] ...;
    X := @key[new] Sep;
@key[end] Pack;

    I : Integer := X.@key{all}'Size; --@RI{ Legal, by AI-00039.}
@key[end] Pack.Child;
@end{example}

Generating code for the above example could be a serious implementation
burden, since it would require all aliased objects to store size dope,
and for that dope to be in the same format for all kinds of types
(or some other equivalently inefficient implementation).
On the contrary, most implementations allocate dope differently (or
not at all) for different designated subtypes.

It should be possible for an access value to designate an object
declared by an object declaration, or a subcomponent thereof.
In implementation terms, this means pointing at stack-allocated and

However, dangling references should be prevented, primarily via
compile-time rules, so long as features like Unchecked_Access and
Unchecked_Deallocation are not used.

In order to create such access values, we require that the access type be a
general access type, that the designated object be aliased,

@Redundant[The accessibility rules,

are written in terms of @i{accessibility levels},
which reflect the run-time nesting of @i{masters}. As explained in
@RefSecNum{Completion and Finalization},
a master is the execution of a

a @nt{subprogram_body}@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[, an @nt{entry_body}, or an @nt{accept_statement}]}.
An accessibility level is @i{deeper than} another if it is more
deeply nested at run time.
For example, an object declared local to a called subprogram has a deeper
accessibility level than an object declared local to the calling
subprogram.
The accessibility rules for access types require that the
accessibility level of an object designated by an access value be no
deeper than that of the access type.
This ensures that the object will live at least as long as the access
type, which in turn ensures that the access value cannot later
designate an object that no longer exists.
The Unchecked_Access attribute may be used to circumvent the
accessibility rules.]

  @Leading@;The definition of the accessibility level of the anonymous type
  of an access parameter@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ specifying an access-to-object

  What we really mean is the view that @lquotes@;would be@rquotes@; denoted by an
  expression @lquotes@;X.@key[all]@rquotes@;, where X is the actual, even though such
  an expression is a figment of our imagination.
  The definition is intended to be equivalent to the
  following more verbose version:
  The accessibility level of the anonymous type of an access parameter is
  as follows:
  @begin{Itemize}
  if the actual is
  an expression of a named access type @em
  the accessibility level of that type;

  if the actual is
  an @nt{allocator} @em
  the accessibility level of the execution of the called
  subprogram;

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised]}@ChgNote{To be consistent with 8652/0006}
  if the actual is
  a reference to the Access attribute @em
  the accessibility level of the view denoted by the @Chg{New=[@nt{prefix}],Old=[prefix]};

  if the actual is
  a reference to the Unchecked_Access attribute @em
  library accessibility level;

  if the actual is
  an access parameter @em
  the accessibility level of its type.
  @end{Itemize}

  Note that the @nt{allocator} case is explicitly mentioned in the RM95,
  because otherwise the definition would be circular:
  the level of the anonymous type is that of the view designated by the
  actual, which is that of the access type.
@end{Honest}
@begin{Discussion}
  A deeper accessibility level implies a shorter maximum lifetime.
  Hence, when a rule requires X to have a level that is
  @lquotes@;not deeper than@rquotes@; Y's level,
  this requires that X has a lifetime at least as long as Y.
  (We say @lquotes@;maximum lifetime@rquotes@; here, because the accessibility
  level really represents an upper bound on the lifetime;
  an object created by an @nt{allocator} can have its lifetime
  prematurely ended by an instance of Unchecked_Deallocation.)

  Package elaborations are not masters, and are therefore
  invisible to the accessibility rules:
  an object declared immediately within a package has the
  same accessibility level as an object declared immediately within the
  declarative region containing the package.
  This is true even in the body of a package;
  it jibes with the fact that objects declared in a
  @nt{package_body} live as long as objects declared
  outside the package,
  even though the body objects are not visible outside the package.

  Note that the level of the @i{view} denoted by X.@key[all]
  can be different from the level of the @i{object} denoted by X.@key[all].
  The former is determined by the type of X;
  the latter is determined either by the type of the @nt{allocator},
  or by the master in which the object was declared.
  The former is used in several @LegalityTitle and runtime checks;
  the latter is used to define when X.@key[all] gets finalized.
  The level of a view reflects what we can conservatively @lquotes@;know@rquotes@;
  about the object of that view;
  for example, due to @nt{type_conversion}s,
  an access value might designate an object that was allocated by an
  @nt{allocator} for a different access type.

  Similarly, the level of the view denoted by X.@key[all].Comp
  can be different from the level of the object denoted by X.@key[all].Comp.

  If Y is statically deeper than X,
  this implies that Y will be (dynamically) deeper than X in all
  possible executions.

  @Leading@;Most accessibility checking is done at compile time;
  the rules are stated in terms of @lquotes@;statically deeper than@rquotes@;.

  If an accessibility @LegalityName is satisfied,

  cannot fail (and a reasonable implementation will not

  unless @Chg{Version=[2],New=[one of the cases requiring runtime checks mentioned
  previously is],Old=[access parameters or shared generic bodies are]} involved.

  Accessibility levels are defined in terms of the relations
  @lquotes@;the same as@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;deeper than@rquotes@;.
  To make the discussion more concrete,
  we can assign actual numbers to each level.
  Here, we assume that library-level accessibility is level 0,
  and each level defined as @lquotes@;deeper than@rquotes@; is one level deeper.
  Thus, a subprogram directly called from the environment task
  (such as the main subprogram) would be at level 1,
  and so on.

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised]}
  Accessibility is not enforced at compile time for access
  parameters@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ of an access-to-object type],Old=[]}.
  The @lquotes@;obvious@rquotes@; implementation of the runtime checks would be
  inefficient, and would involve distributed overhead;
  therefore, an efficient method is given below.
  The @lquotes@;obvious@rquotes@; implementation would be to pass
  the level of the caller at each subprogram call,
  task creation, etc.
  This level would be incremented by 1 for each
  dynamically nested master.
  An Accessibility_Check would be implemented as a simple
  comparison @em checking that X is not deeper than Y
  would involve checking that X <= Y.

  A more efficient method is based on passing @i{static}
  nesting levels
  (within constructs that correspond at run time to
  masters @em packages don't count).
  Whenever an access parameter is passed,
  an implicit extra parameter is passed with it.
  The extra parameter represents (in an indirect way)
  the accessibility level of the anonymous access type,
  and, therefore, the level of the view denoted
  by a dereference of the access parameter.
  This is analogous to the implicit @lquotes@;Constrained@rquotes@; bit associated
  with certain formal parameters of an unconstrained but definite
  composite subtype.
  In this method, we avoid distributed overhead:
  it is not necessary to pass any extra information
  to subprograms that have no access parameters.
  For anything other than an access parameter and its anonymous type,
  the static nesting level is known at compile time,
  and is defined analogously to the RM95 definition
  of accessibility level (e.g. derived access types
  get their nesting level from their parent).
  Checking @lquotes@;not deeper than@rquotes@; is a "<=" test on the levels.

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised]}
  @Leading@keepnext@;For each access parameter@Chg{Version=[2],New=[ of

  For the Accessibility_Check associated with a @nt{type_conversion}

  an access-to-object type],Old=[]} of a given subprogram to a
  named access type,
  if the target type is statically nested within the subprogram,

  Otherwise, check that the value passed in is <= the static

  The other Accessibility_Checks are handled in a similar manner.

  This method, using statically known values most of the time,

The above illegal statements are illegal because the accessibility

than the accessibility level of A0.
In every possible execution of any program including this library

(dynamically) deeper than that of A0.
Note that the accessibility levels of X and Y are the same.

The run-time Accessibility_Check at (1) can never fail,

The check at (2) will fail when called from (3),
but not when called from (4).

@Leading@;Within a @nt{type_declaration}, the rules are checked in an
assume-the-worst manner.
For example:
@begin{Example}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0298-1]}
@key[package] P @key[is]
    @key[type] Int_Ptr @key[is] @key[access] @key[all] Integer;
    @key[type] Rec(D: @key[access] Integer) @key[is] @key[limited] @key[private];
@key[private]
    @key[type] Rec_Ptr @key[is] @key[access] @key[all] Rec;
    @key[function] F(X: Rec_Ptr) @key[return] Boolean;
    @key[function] G(X: @key[access] Rec) @key[return] Boolean;

            C3: Boolean := F(Rec'Access); --@RI{ Illegal!}
            C4: Boolean := G(Rec'Access);
        @key[end] @key[record];
@key[end] P;
@end{Example}

C1, C2, and C3 are all illegal, because one might declare an object of
type Rec at a more deeply nested place than the declaration of the type.
C4 is legal, but the accessibility level of the object will be passed to
function G, and constraint checks within G will prevent it from
doing any evil deeds.

Note that we cannot defer the checks on C1, C2, and C3 until
compile-time of the object creation, because that would cause violation
of the privacy of private parts.
Furthermore, the problems might occur within a task or protected body,
which the compiler can't see while compiling an object creation.

     This restriction is intended to be similar to the restriction
     on renaming discriminant-dependent subcomponents.
  @end{Discussion}
  @begin{Reason}
    This prevents references to subcomponents that might
    disappear or move or change constraints after creating the reference.
  @end{Reason}
  @begin{ImplNote}
     @Leading@;There was some thought to making this restriction
     more stringent, roughly:
     "X shall not denote a subcomponent of a variable
     with discriminant-dependent subcomponents, if the nominal
     subtype of the variable is an unconstrained definite subtype."
     This was because in some implementations, it is not
     just the discriminant-dependent subcomponents that might
     move as the result of an assignment that changed the discriminants
     of the enclosing object. However, it was decided not to make
     this change because a reasonable implementation strategy was identified
     to avoid such problems, as follows:
     @begin(Itemize)
       Place nondiscriminant-dependent components with any aliased parts
       at offsets preceding any discriminant-dependent components
       in a discriminated record type with defaulted discriminants.

       Preallocate the maximum space for unconstrained discriminated
       variables with aliased subcomponents, rather than allocating
       the initial size and moving them to a larger (heap-resident)
       place if they grow as the result of an assignment.
     @end(Itemize)

     Note that for objects of a by-reference type, it is not an error
     for a programmer to take advantage of the fact that such objects
     are passed by reference. Therefore, the above approach is also
     necessary for discriminated record types with components of
     a by-reference type.

     To make the above strategy work, it is important that
     a component of a derived type is defined to be
     discriminant-dependent if it is inherited and the parent subtype
     constraint is defined in terms of a discriminant of the derived type
     (see @RefSecNum(Discriminants)).

The predefined operations of an access type also include
the assignment operation, qualification, and membership tests.
Explicit conversion is allowed between general access types with
matching designated subtypes; explicit conversion is allowed

(see @RefSecNum{Type Conversions}).

@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Anonymous access types can use the universal access

The object or subprogram designated by an access value can be named
with a dereference, either an @nt<explicit_@!dereference> or an
@nt<implicit_dereference>. See @RefSecNum{Names}.

A call through the dereference of an access-to-subprogram

Note that using
an access-to-class-wide tagged type with a dispatching operation
is a potentially more structured alternative to using an
access-to-subprogram type.

An implementation may consider
two access-to-subprogram values to be unequal,
even though they designate the same subprogram. This might
be because one points directly to the subprogram,
while the other points to a special prologue that
performs an Elaboration_Check and then jumps to the subprogram.
See @RefSecNum(Relational Operators and Membership Tests).

access-to-subprogram values is important to the logic

imported @em see @RefSecNum{Interfacing Aspects}],Old=[]}),
a check is made that the @nt<protected_body> is already elaborated.
This check and the evaluations of any actual parameters of the call
are done in an arbitrary order.@PDefn2{Term=[arbitrary order],Sec=[allowed]}
@begin{Discussion}
  A protected type has only one elaboration @lquotes@;bit,@rquotes@; rather than
  one for each operation, because one call may result in evaluating
  the barriers of other entries, and because there are no elaborable
  declarations between the bodies of the operations. In fact,
  the elaboration of a @nt<protected_body> does not elaborate
  the enclosed bodies, since they are not considered independently
  elaborable.

  Note that there is no elaboration check when calling a task entry.
  Task entry calls are permitted even before the associated @nt<task_body>
  has been seen. Such calls are simply queued until the task is
  activated and reaches a corresponding @nt<accept_statement>.
  We considered a similar rule for protected entries @em simply
  queuing all calls until the @nt<protected_body> was seen, but felt
  it was not worth the possible implementation overhead, particularly
  given that there might be multiple instances of the protected type.
@end{Discussion}

For the activation of a task, a check is made by the
activator that the @nt{task_body} is already elaborated.
If two or more tasks are being activated together
(see @RefSecNum{Task Execution - Task Activation}),
as the result of the elaboration of
a @nt{declarative_part} or the initialization
for the object created by an allocator,
this check is done for all of them before activating any
of them.
@begin{Reason}
  As specified by AI83-00149, the check is done by the
  activator, rather than by the task itself. If it were
  done by the task itself, it would be turned into a Tasking_Error
  in the activator, and the other tasks would still be activated.
@end{Reason}

For the instantiation of a generic unit that has a body, a check is
made that this body is already elaborated.
This check and the evaluation of any @nt{explicit_generic_actual_parameter}s
of the instantiation are done in an arbitrary order.@PDefn2{Term=[arbitrary order],Sec=[allowed]}
@end{Itemize}

@Defn2{Term=[Program_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
The exception Program_Error is raised if any of these checks fails.

@begin{Extend83}
@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
The syntax for @nt{declarative_part} is modified to remove the ordering
restrictions of Ada 83; that is, the distinction between
@nt{basic_declarative_item}s and @ntf{later_declarative_item}s
within @nt{declarative_part}s is removed.
This means that things like @nt{use_clause}s and
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt{object_declaration}s],Old=[@ntf{variable_declaration}s]}
can be freely intermixed with things like bodies.

The syntax rule for @nt{proper_body} now allows a @nt{protected_body},
and the rules for elaboration checks now cover calls on
protected operations.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{DiffWord83}
The syntax rule for @ntf{later_declarative_item} is removed;
the syntax rule for @nt{declarative_item} is new.

RM83 defines @lquotes@;elaborated@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;not yet elaborated@rquotes@; for
@nt{declarative_item}s here, and for other things in @RefSec{Declarations}.
That's no longer necessary, since these terms are fully defined in
@RefSecNum{Declarations}.

In RM83, all uses of @nt{declarative_part} are optional
(except for the one in @nt{block_statement} with a @key(declare))
which is sort of strange, since a @nt{declarative_part} can be empty,
according to the syntax.
That is, @nt{declarative_part}s are sort of @lquotes@;doubly optional@rquotes@;.
In Ada 95, these @nt{declarative_part}s are always required
(but can still be empty).
To simplify description, we go further and say
(see @RefSec(Block Statements)) that a
@nt<block_statement> without an explicit @nt<declarative_part>
is equivalent to one with an empty one.

@Defn{requires a completion}
A declaration that requires a second part is said to @i(require completion).
@Defn2{Term=[completion], Sec=(compile-time concept)}

@begin{Discussion}
@Leading@keepnext@;Throughout the RM95, there are rules about completions that

Which constructs can only serve as the completion

Where the completion of a declaration is allowed to be.

What kinds of completions are allowed to correspond to each kind of
declaration that allows one.

Don't confuse this compile-time concept with
the run-time concept of completion
defined in @RefSecNum{Completion and Finalization}.

Note that the declaration of a private type (if limited) can be
completed with the declaration of a task type, which is then completed
with a body.
Thus, a declaration can actually come in @i{three} parts.

@end{Honest}

@begin(Discussion)
  @ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0299-1]}
  The implicit declarations of predefined operators are not allowed to
  have a completion.
  Enumeration literals, although they are subprograms, are not allowed to have a
  corresponding @nt{subprogram_body}.
  That's because the completion rules are described in terms of constructs
  (@nt{subprogram_declaration}s) and not entities (subprograms).
  When a completion is required, it has to be explicit;
  the implicit null @nt{package_body} that @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Clause],Old=[Section]}
  @RefSecNum{Packages}
  talks about cannot serve as the completion of a
  @nt{package_declaration} if a completion is required.
@end(Discussion)

At most one completion is allowed for a given declaration.
Additional requirements on completions appear where each kind
of completion is defined.
@begin{Ramification}
A subunit is not a completion;
the stub is.

If the completion of a declaration is also a declaration,
then @i{that} declaration might have a completion, too.
For example, a limited private type can be completed with a task type,
which can then be completed with a task body.
This is not a violation of the @lquotes@;at most one completion@rquotes@; rule.

@Defn{completely defined}
A type is @i(completely defined) at a place that is after its
full type definition (if it has one) and after all of its
subcomponent types are completely defined.
A type shall be completely defined before it is frozen
(see @RefSecNum{Freezing Rules} and
@RefSecNum{Private Types and Private Extensions}).

Completions are in principle allowed for any kind of explicit declaration.

@end(Discussion)

There are rules that prevent premature uses of declarations that have a
corresponding completion.
The Elaboration_Checks of @RefSecNum{Declarative Parts} prevent such
uses at run time for subprograms, protected operations, tasks, and
generic units.
The rules of @RefSec{Freezing Rules}
prevent, at compile time, premature uses of other entities
such as private types and deferred constants.
