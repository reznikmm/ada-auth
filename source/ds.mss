@LabeledNormativeAnnex{Distributed Systems}

@begin{Intro}
@redundant[This Annex defines facilities for supporting the implementation
of distributed systems using multiple partitions working
cooperatively as part of a single Ada program.]
@end{Intro}

@begin{Extend83}
@Defn{extensions to Ada 83}
This Annex is new to Ada 95.
@end{Extend83}

@begin{LinkTime}

@Defn{processing node}
@Defn{storage node}
@Defn{distributed system}
A @i{distributed system} is an interconnection of one or more
@i{processing nodes} (a system resource that has both computational
and storage capabilities), and zero or more @i{storage nodes}
(a system resource that has only storage capabilities, with the storage
addressable by one or more processing nodes).

@Defn{distributed program}
A @i{distributed program} comprises one or more partitions that
execute independently (except when they communicate) in a distributed system.

@Defn2{Term=[configuration], Sec=(of the partitions of a program)}
The process of mapping the partitions of a program
to the nodes in a distributed system is
called @i{configuring the partitions of the program}.
@end{LinkTime}

@begin{ImplReq}

The implementation shall provide means for explicitly assigning library
units to a partition and for the configuring and execution of a program
consisting of multiple partitions on a distributed system;
the means are implementation defined.
@ImplDef{The means for creating and executing distributed programs.}

@end{ImplReq}

@begin{ImplPerm}

An implementation may require that the set of processing nodes of
a distributed system be homogeneous.

@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{Notes}


The partitions comprising a program may be executed on differently
configured distributed systems or on a nondistributed system without
requiring recompilation.
A distributed program may be partitioned differently from the same set of
library units without recompilation.
The resulting execution is semantically equivalent.

A distributed program retains the same type safety
as the equivalent single partition program.



@end{Notes}

@LabeledClause{Partitions}

@begin{Intro}
@redundant[The partitions of a distributed program are classified as either
active or passive.]
@end{Intro}

@begin{LinkTime}

@Defn{active partition}
@Defn{passive partition}
An @i{active partition} is a partition as defined in
@RefSecNum{Program Execution}. A @i{passive partition} is a partition
that has no thread of control of its own, whose
library units are all preelaborated, and whose data and subprograms are
accessible to one or more active partitions.
@begin{Discussion}
In most situations, a passive partition does not execute, and does not have
a @lquotes@;real@rquotes@; environment task. Any execution involved in
its elaboration and initialization occurs before it comes into existence in a
distributed program (like most preelaborated entities). Likewise,
there is no concrete meaning to passive partition termination.
@end{Discussion}

A passive partition shall include only @nt{library_item}s that either are
declared pure or are shared
passive (see @RefSecNum{Elaboration Control} and
@RefSecNum{Shared Passive Library Units}).

An active partition shall be configured on a processing node.
A passive partition shall be configured either on a storage node
or on a processing node.

The configuration of the partitions of a program onto a
distributed system shall
be consistent with the possibility for data references or calls
between the partitions implied by their semantic dependences.
@Defn{remote access}
Any reference to data or call of
a subprogram across partitions is called a @i{remote access}.
@begin{Discussion}
For example, an active partition that includes a unit with a semantic
dependence on the declaration of another RCI package of some other active
partition has to be connected to that other partition by some sort
of a message passing mechanism.

A passive partition that is accessible to an active partition should have
its storage addressable to the processor(s) of the active partition. The
processor(s) should be able to read and write from/to that
storage, as well as
to perform @lquotes@;read-modify-write@rquotes@; operations (in order to support entry-less
protected objects).

@end{Discussion}

@end{LinkTime}

@begin{RunTime}

@Defn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(partition)}
A @nt{library_item} is elaborated as part of the elaboration
of each partition that includes it.
If a normal library unit
(see @RefSecNum{Categorization of Library Units}) has state, then a separate
copy of the state exists in each active partition that elaborates it.
@Redundant[The state evolves independently in each such partition.]


@begin{Ramification}
Normal library units cannot be included in passive partitions.

@Defn{inaccessible partition}
@Defn{accessible partition}
@Redundant[An active partition @i{terminates} when its environment task
terminates.] A partition becomes @i{inaccessible} if it terminates or if
it is @i{aborted}. An active partition is aborted when its environment
task is aborted. In addition, if a partition fails during its
elaboration, it becomes inaccessible to other partitions. Other
implementation-defined events can also result in a partition becoming
inaccessible.
@ImplDef{Any events that can result in a partition becoming

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00226-01]}
@PDefn2{Term=(bounded error),Sec=(cause)}
It is a bounded error for there to be cyclic elaboration dependences
between the active partitions of a single distributed
program.
The possible effects@Chg{Version=[2],New=[, in each of the partitions involved,],Old=[]}
are deadlock during elaboration, or the raising of
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Communication_Error or ],Old=[]}Program_Error@Chg{Version=[2],
New=[],Old=[ in one or all of the active partitions involved]}.
@end{Bounded}

@begin{ImplPerm}

An implementation may allow multiple active or passive partitions
to be configured on
a single processing node, and multiple passive partitions to be
configured on a single storage node.
In these cases, the scheduling policies, treatment
of priorities, and management of shared resources between
these partitions are implementation defined.
@ImplDef{The scheduling policies, treatment
of priorities, and management of shared resources between
partitions in certain cases.}

An implementation may allow separate copies of an active partition to be
configured on different processing nodes, and to provide
appropriate interactions between the copies to present
a consistent state of the partition to other active partitions.
@begin{Ramification}
  The language does not specify the nature of these interactions,
  nor the actual level of consistency preserved.
@end{Ramification}

In an implementation, the partitions of a distributed
program need not be loaded and elaborated all at the same time;
they may be loaded and elaborated one at a time over an extended
period of time. An implementation may provide facilities to abort
and reload a partition during the execution of a distributed program.

An implementation may allow the state of some of the partitions of
a distributed program to persist while other partitions of the program
terminate and are later reinvoked.
@end{ImplPerm}

@begin{Notes}

Library units are grouped into partitions after compile time,
but before run time.
At compile time, only the relevant library unit properties are
identified using categorization pragmas.


The value returned by the Partition_Id attribute can be used as a
parameter to implementation-provided subprograms in order
to query information about the partition.

@Defn{unit consistency}
In a distributed program, a library unit is @i{consistent} if the same

It is a bounded error to elaborate a partition of a distributed
program that contains a compilation unit that depends on a different
version of the declaration of a shared passive or RCI library
unit than
that included in the partition to which the shared passive or
RCI library unit
was assigned.
As a result of this error, Program_Error

in any case, the partitions
become inaccessible to one another.
@begin{Ramification}
  Because a version changes if anything on which it depends undergoes
  a version change, requiring consistency for shared passive
  and remote call interface library units is
  sufficient to ensure
  consistency for the declared pure and remote types library
  units that
  define the types used for the objects and parameters
  through which interpartition communication takes place.

  Note that we do not require matching Body_Versions; it is
  irrelevant for shared passive and remote call interface
  packages, since only one copy of their body exists in a
  distributed program (in the absence of implicit replication),
  and we allow the bodies to differ for declared pure and
  remote types packages from partition to partition, presuming
  that the differences are due to required error corrections

@Defn{remote subprogram call}
@RootDefn{asynchronous remote procedure call}
@Defn{calling partition}
@Defn{called partition}
@Defn{remote subprogram binding}
A @i{remote subprogram call} is a subprogram call that invokes the
execution of a subprogram in another partition.
The partition that
originates the remote subprogram call is the @i{calling partition}, and the
partition that executes the corresponding subprogram body is the @i{called
partition}.
Some remote procedure calls are allowed to return prior to the completion of
subprogram execution. These are called @i{asynchronous remote procedure
calls}.

@Leading@;There are three different ways of performing a remote subprogram call:
@begin{Itemize}
  As a direct call on a (remote) subprogram explicitly declared in a
  remote call interface;

  As an indirect call through a value of a remote access-to-subprogram type;

  As a dispatching call with a controlling operand designated by
  a value of a remote access-to-class-wide type.
@end{Itemize}

The first way of calling corresponds to a @i(static) binding between
the calling and the called partition.
The latter two ways correspond to a @i(dynamic) binding between
the calling and the called partition.

@Defn{marshalling}
@Defn{unmarshalling}
@PDefn2{Term=[execution], Sec=(remote subprogram call)}
For the execution of a remote subprogram call, subprogram parameters
(and later the results, if any) are passed using a stream-oriented
representation
(see @RefSecNum{The Streams Subsystem}) @Redundant[which is
suitable for transmission between partitions]. This action is called
@i{marshalling}. @i{Unmarshalling} is the reverse action of
reconstructing the parameters or results from the stream-oriented
representation.
@redundant[Marshalling is performed initially as part of the remote subprogram call in
the calling partition; unmarshalling is done in the called partition.
After the remote subprogram completes, marshalling is performed in the
called partition, and finally unmarshalling is done in the calling
partition.]

@Defn{calling stub}
@Defn{receiving stub}
A @i{calling stub} is the sequence of code that replaces the subprogram
body of a remotely called subprogram in the calling partition. A
@i{receiving stub} is the sequence of code (the @lquotes@;wrapper@rquotes@;) that
receives a remote subprogram call on the called partition and invokes
the appropriate subprogram body.
@begin{Discussion}
The use of the term @i{stub} in this annex should not be confused with
@nt{body_stub} as defined in @RefSecNum{Subunits of Compilation Units}. The
term @i{stub} is used here because it is a commonly understood term when
talking about the RPC paradigm.
@end{Discussion}

@Defn{at-most-once execution}
Remote subprogram calls are executed at most once, that is,
if the subprogram call returns normally, then the called
subprogram's body was executed exactly once.

The task executing a remote subprogram call blocks until the subprogram
in the called partition returns, unless the call is asynchronous. For an
asynchronous remote procedure call, the calling task can
become ready before the
procedure in the called partition returns.

@Defn{cancellation of a remote subprogram call}
If a construct containing a remote call is aborted, the
remote subprogram call is @i{cancelled}.
Whether the execution of the remote subprogram is immediately aborted
as a result of the cancellation is implemen@!tation defined.
@ImplDef{Whether the execution of the remote subprogram is immediately
aborted as a result of cancellation.}

If a remote subprogram call is received by a called partition before the
partition has
completed its elaboration, the call is kept pending until the called
partition completes its elaboration (unless the call is
cancelled by the calling partition prior to that).

If an exception is propagated by a remotely called subprogram,
and the call is not an asynchronous call,
the corresponding exception is reraised at the point
of the remote subprogram call.
For an asynchronous call, if the remote procedure call returns prior to
the completion of the remotely called subprogram, any exception is lost.

The exception Communication_Error
(see @RefSecNum{Partition Communication Subsystem}) is raised if a remote call
cannot be completed due to difficulties in communicating with the called
partition.

(see @Chg{Version=[5],New=[@RefSecNum{Intertask Communication}],
Old=[@RefSecNum{Protected Subprograms and Protected Actions}]}).
@begin{Reason}
Asynchronous remote procedure calls are potentially blocking since the
implementation may require waiting for the availability of shared resources
to initiate the remote call.

@IndexCheck{Accessibility_Check}
In a remote subprogram call with a formal parameter of a class-wide
type, a check is made that the tag of the actual parameter identifies
a tagged type declared in a declared-pure or shared passive library
unit, or in the visible part of a remote types or remote call interface
library unit.
@Defn2{Term=[Program_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
Program_Error is raised if this check fails.
@Chg{New=[In a remote function call which returns a class-wide type, the same
check is made on the function result.],Old=[]}
@begin{Discussion}
  @ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0085],ARef=[AI95-00215-01]}
  This check makes certain that the specific type passed@Chg{New=[ or returned],
  Old=[]} in an RPC
  satisfies the rules for a "communicable" type. Normally this
  is guaranteed by the compile-time restrictions on remote call interfaces.
  However, with class-wide types, it is possible to pass an object
  whose tag identifies a type declared outside the "safe" packages.

  This is considered an accessibility_check since only the types
  declared in "safe" packages are considered truly "global" (cross-partition).
  Other types are local to a single partition. This is analogous
  to the "accessibility" of global vs. local declarations in
  a single-partition program.

  This rule replaces a rule from an early version of Ada 9X
  which was given in the subclause on Remote Types Library Units
  (now @RefSec{Remote Types Library Units}). That rule tried
  to prevent "bad" types from being sent by arranging for their
  tags to mismatch between partitions. However, that interfered
  with other uses of tags. The new rule allows tags to agree
  in all partitions, even for those types which are not "safe"
  to pass in an RPC.
@end{Discussion}

@IndexCheck{Partition_Check}
In a dispatching call with two or more controlling operands that are
designated by values of a remote access-to-class-wide type,
a check is made @Redundant[(in addition to the normal Tag_Check
@em see @RefSecNum{Suppressing Checks})] that all the remote
access-to-class-wide values originated from Access
@nt<attribute_reference>s that were evaluated by tasks of the
same active partition.
@Defn2{Term=[Constraint_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
Constraint_Error is raised if this check fails.
@begin{ImplNote}
  When a remote access-to-class-wide value is created by
  an Access @nt<attribute_reference>, the identity of the
  active partition that evaluated the @nt<attribute_reference>
  should be recorded in the representation of the remote access value.
@end{ImplNote}

@end{RunTime}

@begin{ImplReq}

The implementation of remote subprogram calls shall conform
to the PCS interface as defined by the specification of the
language-defined package System.RPC
(see @RefSecNum{Partition Communication Subsystem}).
The calling stub shall use the Do_RPC procedure unless the remote
procedure call is asynchronous in which case Do_APC shall be used.
On the receiving side, the corresponding receiving stub shall be
invoked by the RPC-receiver.
@begin{ImplNote}
One possible implementation model is as follows:

The code for calls to subprograms declared in an RCI
package is generated
normally, that is, the call-site is the same as for a
local subprogram call.
The code for the remotely callable subprogram bodies is also generated
normally. Subprogram's prologue and epilogue are the same as for a local call.

When compiling the specification of an RCI package, the compiler
generates calling stubs for each visible subprogram. Similarly, when
compiling the body of an RCI package, the compiler generates
receiving stubs for each visible subprogram together with the appropriate
tables to allow the RPC-receiver to locate the correct receiving stub.

For the statically bound remote calls, the identity of the remote
partition is statically determined (it is resolved at configuration/link time).

@Leading@;The calling stub operates as follows:
@begin(Itemize)
It allocates (or reuses) a stream of Params_Stream_Type of Initial_Size,
and initializes it by repeatedly calling Write operations,
first to identify which remote subprogram in the receiving partition
is being called, and then to pass the incoming value of each of the
@b(in) and @b(in out) parameters of the call.


@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
It allocates (or reuses) a stream for the Result,
unless @Chg{Version=[3],New=[an aspect],Old=[a pragma]} Asynchronous is
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[specified as True for],Old=[applied to]} the procedure.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
It calls Do_RPC unless @Chg{Version=[3],New=[an aspect],Old=[a pragma]}
Asynchronous @Chg{Version=[3],New=[is specified as True for],Old=[applied to]}
the procedure
in which case it calls Do_APC. An access value designating the message
stream allocated and initialized above is passed as the Params parameter.
An access value designating the Result stream is passed as the Result
parameter.


@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
If the @Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspect],Old=[pragma]} Asynchronous is not specified for the procedure,
Do_RPC blocks until a reply message arrives,
and then returns to the calling stub.
The stub returns after extracting
from the Result stream, using Read operations, the @b(in out) and @b(out)
parameters or the function result. If the reply message
indicates that the execution of the remote subprogram propagated
an exception, the exception is propagated from Do_RPC to the
calling stub, and thence to the point of the original remote subprogram call.
If Do_RPC detects that communication with the remote partition has
failed, it propagates Communication_Error.

@end(Itemize)

@Leading@;On the receiving side, the RPC-receiver procedure operates as follows:
@begin(Itemize)
It is called from the PCS when a remote-subprogram-call message is received.
The call originates in some remote call receiver task executed and
managed in the context of the PCS.

It extracts information from the stream to identify the appropriate
receiving stub.

The receiving stub extracts the @b(in) and @b(in out) parameters using
Read from the stream designated by the Params parameter.

The receiving stub calls the actual subprogram body and, upon completion of
the subprogram, uses Write to insert the results into the
stream pointed to by the Result parameter. The receiving stub returns to
the RPC-receiver procedure which in turn returns to the PCS.
If the actual subprogram body propagates an exception, it is propagated
by the RPC-receiver to the PCS, which handles the exception,
and indicates in the reply message that the execution of the
subprogram body propagated an exception. The exception occurrence
can be represented in the reply message using the Write attribute
of Ada.Exceptions.Exception_Occurrence.
@end(Itemize)

For remote access-to-subprogram types:

A value of a remote access-to-subprogram type can be
represented by the following components: a reference to the remote partition,
an index to the package containing the remote subprogram, and an index to
the subprogram within the package. The values of these components are
determined at run time when the remote access value is created.
These three components serve the same purpose when calling Do_APC/RPC,
as in the statically bound remote calls; the only difference is that they
are evaluated dynamically.

For remote access-to-class-wide types:

For each remote access-to-class-wide type,
a calling stub is generated for each dispatching operation of
the designated type. In addition, receiving stubs are generated to perform
the remote dispatching operations in the called partition. The appropriate
@nt{subprogram_body} is determined as for a local
dispatching call once the receiving stub has been reached.

A value of a remote access-to-class-wide type
can be represented with the following components:
a reference to the remote partition, an index to a table (created one per
each such access type) containing addresses of all the dispatching operations
of the designated type, and an access value designating the actual remote
object.

Alternatively, a remote access-to-class-wide value can be represented as
a normal access value, pointing to a "stub" object which in turn
contains the information mentioned above. A call on any
dispatching operation of such a stub object does the remote call,
if necessary, using the information in the stub object to locate
the target partition, etc. This approach has the advantage that
less special-casing is required in the compiler. All access values
can remain just a simple address.

@Defn2{Term=[Constraint_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
For a call to Do_RPC or Do_APC: The partition ID of all controlling
operands are checked for equality (a Constraint_Error is raised if this
check fails). The partition ID value is used for the Partition parameter.
An index into the @i{tagged-type-descriptor} is created. This index
points to the receiving stub of the class-wide operation. This index and
the index to the table (described above) are
written to the stream.
Then, the actual parameters are marshalled into the message
stream. For a controlling operand, only the access value
designating the remote object is required (the other two
components are already present in the other parameters).

On the called partition (after the RPC-receiver has transferred control
to the appropriate receiving stub) the parameters are first unmarshalled.
Then, the tags of the controlling operands (obtained by dereferencing the
pointer to the object) are checked for equality.
@Defn2{Term=[Constraint_Error],Sec=(raised by failure of runtime check)}
If the check fails Constraint_Error is raised and propagated back to the
calling partition, unless it is a result of an asynchronous call.
Finally, a dispatching call to the specific subprogram (based on the
controlling object's tag) is made. Note that since this subprogram is not
in an RCI package, no specific stub is generated for it, it is called
normally from the @i{dispatching stub}.

@begin{Notes}
A given active partition can both make and receive remote subprogram calls.
Thus, an active partition can act as both a client and a server.

If a given exception is propagated by a remote

partition, the exception can be handled by an @key(others) choice

@begin{itemize}
The package Tapes provides the necessary declarations of the type and its
primitive operations.

Name_Server is a remote call interface package and is elaborated in a separate
active partition to provide the necessary naming services (such as Register
and Find) to the entire distributed program
through remote subprogram calls.

Tape_Driver is a normal package that is elaborated in a partition configured
on the processing node that is connected to the tape device(s). The abstract
operations are overridden to support
the locally declared tape devices (Tape1, Tape2). The package is not visible
to its clients, but it exports the tape devices (as remote objects)
through the services of the Name_Server. This allows for tape devices to be
dynamically added, removed or replaced without requiring the modification of
the clients' code.

The Tape_Client procedure references only declarations in the Tapes and
Name_Server packages. Before using a tape for the first time, it needs to
query the Name_Server for a system-wide identity for that tape. From then on,
it can use that identity to access the tape device.

Values of remote access type Tape_Ptr include the necessary information to
complete the remote dispatching operations that result from
dereferencing the controlling operands T1 and T2.

the underlying communication system in which case Communication_Error is
raised at the point of the call to Do_RPC.
@begin{Reason}
Only one exception is defined in System.RPC, although many sources of errors
might exist. This is so because it is not always possible
to distinguish among these errors. In particular, it is often impossible to
tell the difference between a failing communication link and
a failing processing node. Additional information might be associated with
a particular Exception_Occurrence for a Communication_Error.
@end{Reason}

Do_APC operates in the same way as Do_RPC except that it
is allowed to return immediately after sending the message.

Upon normal return, the stream designated by the Result parameter
of Do_RPC contains the reply message.

@PDefn2{Term=[elaboration], Sec=(partition)}
The procedure System.RPC.Establish_RPC_Receiver is called
once, immediately after elaborating
the library units of an active partition
(that is, right after the @i{elaboration of the partition}) if the partition
includes an RCI library unit, but prior to invoking the main
subprogram, if any.
The Partition parameter is the Partition_Id of the active partition
being elaborated.
@Defn{RPC-receiver}
The Receiver parameter designates an
implementation-provided procedure called the
@i{RPC-receiver} which will handle all RPCs received by the
partition from the PCS.
Establish_RPC_Receiver saves a reference to the RPC-receiver;
when a message is received at the called partition, the RPC-receiver
is called with the Params stream containing
the message. When the RPC-receiver
returns, the contents of the stream designated by Result is
placed in a message and sent back to the calling partition.
@begin{ImplNote}
It is defined by the PCS implementation whether one or more threads of control
should be available to process incoming messages and to wait for their
completion.
@end{ImplNote}
@begin{ImplNote}
At link-time, the linker provides the RPC-receiver and the necessary tables
to support it. A call on Establish_RPC_Receiver is inserted just before
the call on the main subprogram.
@end{ImplNote}
@begin{Reason}
The interface between the PCS (the System.RPC package) and the
RPC-receiver is defined to be dynamic in order to allow the elaboration
sequence to notify the PCS that all packages have been
elaborated and that it is safe to call the receiving stubs. It is not
guaranteed that the PCS units will be the last to be elaborated, so some
other indication that elaboration is complete is needed.
@end{Reason}

If a call on Do_RPC is aborted, a cancellation message is sent
to the called partition, to request that the execution of the
remotely called subprogram be aborted.
@begin{Honest}
The full effects of this message are dependent on the implementation of
the PCS.

@begin{ImplPerm}

The PCS is allowed to contain implementation-defined interfaces for
explicit message passing, broadcasting, etc. Similarly, it is allowed
to provide additional
interfaces to query the state of some remote partition (given its partition
ID) or of the PCS itself, to set timeouts and retry parameters, to get more
detailed error status, etc. These
additional interfaces should be provided in child packages of System.RPC.
@ImplDef{Implementation-defined interfaces in the PCS.}

A body for the package System.RPC need not be supplied by the
implementation.
@begin{Reason}
  It is presumed that a body for the package System.RPC might be
  extremely environment specific. Therefore, we do not require
  that a body be provided by the (compiler) implementation. The user
  will have to write a body, or acquire one, appropriate for the
  target environment.

@begin{Notes}
  The package System.RPC is not designed for direct calls by user
  programs. It is instead designed for use in the implementation of remote
  subprograms calls, being called by the calling stubs generated for a
  remote call interface library unit to initiate a remote call,
  and in turn calling back to an
  RPC-receiver that dispatches to the receiving stubs generated
  for the body of a remote call interface, to handle a remote call
  received from elsewhere.
