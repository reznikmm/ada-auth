properties that need to be known before the compiler can generate code to

those that only need to be known before they can be used. For instance, how an

@begin{Resolution}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
In @Chg{New=[an operational item or],Old=[a]} representation item,
if the @nt<local_name> is a @nt<direct_name>, then it shall
resolve to denote a declaration
(or, in the case of a @nt{pragma}, one or more declarations)
that occurs immediately within the same
declarative region as the @Chg{New=[],Old=[representation ]}item.
If the @nt<local_name> has an @nt<attribute_designator>, then it shall
resolve to denote an implementation-defined
component (see @RefSecNum{Record Representation Clauses})
or a class-wide
type implicitly declared immediately within the same
declarative region as the @Chg{New=[],Old=[representation ]}item.
A @nt<local_name> that is a @i{library_unit_}@nt<name> (only
permitted in a representation pragma) shall resolve
to denote the @nt<library_item> that immediately precedes
(except for other pragmas) the representation pragma.
@begin{Reason}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
This is a @ResolutionName,
because we don't want @Chg{New=[an operational or],Old=[a]} representation
item for X to be ambiguous just because there's another X declared in an outer
declarative region.
It doesn't make much difference, since most
@Chg{New=[operational or ],Old=[]}representation items are for types or
subtypes, and type and subtype names can't be overloaded.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
The visibility rules imply that the declaration has to occur
before the @Chg{New=[operational or ],Old=[]}representation item.

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
For objects, this implies that @Chg{New=[operational or ],Old=[]}representation items can be
applied only to stand-alone objects.
@end{Ramification}
@end{Resolution}

@begin{Legality}
@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
The @nt{local_name} of @Chg{New=[an @nt<aspect_clause>],
Old=[a @nt<representation_clause>]} or representation pragma shall
statically denote an entity (or, in the case of a @nt{pragma},
one or more entities) declared immediately preceding it in a @nt<compilation>,
or within the same @nt{declarative_@!part}, @nt{package_@!specification},
@nt{task_@!definition}, @nt{protected_@!definition}, or
@nt{record_@!definition} as the representation @Chg{New=[or operational ],Old=[]}item.
If a @nt<local_name> denotes a @Redundant[local] callable entity,
it may do so through a @Redundant[local]
@nt<subprogram_@!renaming_@!declaration>
@Redundant[(as a way to resolve ambiguity in the presence of overloading)];
otherwise, the @nt<local_name> shall not denote a @nt<renaming_@!declaration>.
@begin{Ramification}
The @lquotes@;statically denote@rquotes@; part
implies that it is impossible to specify the representation of
an object that is not a stand-alone object,
except in the case of a representation
item like pragma Atomic
that is allowed inside a @nt{component_list}
(in which case the representation item specifies
the representation of components of all objects of the type).
It also prevents the problem of
renamings of things like @lquotes@;P.@key[all]@rquotes@;
(where P is an access-to-subprogram value)
or @lquotes@;E(I)@rquotes@; (where E is an entry family).

The part about where the denoted entity has to have been
declared appears twice @em once as a @ResolutionName,
and once as a @LegalityName.
Suppose P renames Q,
and we have a representation item in a @nt{declarative_part}
whose @nt<local_name> is P.
The fact that the representation item has to appear in the same
@nt{declarative_part} as P is a @ResolutionName,
whereas the fact that the representation item has to appear in the
same @nt{declarative_part} as Q is a @LegalityName.
This is subtle, but it seems like the least confusing set of rules.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Discussion}
  A separate @LegalityName applies for @nt<component_clause>s.
  See @RefSec{Record Representation Clauses}.

@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[In the case of composite objects, we want the
implementation to have the flexibility to either do operations
component-by-component, or with a block operation covering all of the bits. We
carefully avoid giving a preference in the wording. There is no requirement

choice based on many factors, and could make a different choice for different
operations on the same object.]}

@end{Discussion}
@begin{Ramification}
@Leading@;Two objects with the same value do not necessarily have the same
representation.
For example, an implementation might represent False as zero and True
as any odd value.
Similarly, two objects (of the same type)
with the same sequence of bits do not necessarily have the
same value.
For example, an implementation might use a biased representation in
some cases but not others:
@begin{Example}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
@key[subtype] S @key[is] Integer @key[range] 1..256;
@key[type] A @key[is] @key[array](Natural @key[range] 1..4) @key[of] S@Chg{Version=[3],New=[
   @key[with] Pack],Old=[;
@key[pragma] Pack(A)]};
X : S := 3;
Y : A := (1, 2, 3, 4);
@end{Example}

The implementation might use a biased-by-1 representation for the
array elements, but not for X.
X and Y(3) have the same value, but different representation:
the representation of X is a sequence of (say) 32 bits: 0...011,
whereas the representation of Y(3) is a sequence of 8 bits:
00000010 (assuming a two's complement representation).

Such tricks are not required, but are allowed.
@end{Ramification}
@begin{Discussion}
  The value of any padding bits is not specified by the language,
  though for a numeric type, it will be much harder to properly implement
  the predefined operations if the padding bits are not either all zero,
  or a sign extension.
@end{Discussion}
@begin{Ramification}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
For example, suppose S'Size = 2, and an object X is of subtype S.
If the machine code typically uses a 32-bit load instruction to load the
value of X, then X'Size should be 32, even though 30 bits of the value
are just zeros or sign-extension bits.
On the other hand, if the machine code typically masks out those 30
bits, then X'Size should be 2.
Usually, such masking only happens for components of a composite type
for which @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Pack],Old=[packing]}, Component_Size, or
record layout is specified.

Note, however, that the formal parameter of an instance of
Unchecked_Conversion is a special case.
Its Size is required to be the same as that of its subtype.

Note that we don't generally talk about the representation of a
value.
A value is considered to be an amorphous blob
without any particular representation.
An object is considered to be more concrete.

Loads and stores through X1 would read and write 16 bits,
but X1 points to a 32-bit location.
Depending on the endianness of the machine,
loads might load the wrong 16 bits.
Stores would fail to zero the other half in any case.

Loads and stores through X2 would read and write 32 bits,
but X2 points to a 16-bit location.
Thus, adjacent memory locations would be trashed.

Hence, the above is illegal.
Furthermore, the compiler is forbidden from choosing different
Sizes by default, for the same reason.

@begin{Incompatible83}
@Defn{incompatibilities with Ada 83}
It is now illegal for a representation item to cause a derived
by-reference type to have a different record layout from its
parent.
This is necessary for by-reference parameter passing to be feasible.
This only affects programs that specify the representation of types
derived from types containing tasks;
most by-reference types are new to Ada 95.
For example, if A1 is an array of tasks, and A2 is derived from A1,
it is illegal to apply a @nt{pragma} Pack to A2.

The syntax rule for @ntf{type_representation_clause} is removed;
the right-hand side of that rule is moved up to where it was used,
in @Chg{New=[@nt{aspect_clause}],Old=[@nt{representation_clause}]}.
There are two references to @lquotes@;type representation clause@rquotes@; in RM83,
both in Section 13; these have been reworded.
@Chg{New=[Also, the @ntf{representation_clause} has been renamed the
@nt{aspect_clause} to reflect that it can be used to control more than just
representation aspects.],Old=[]}

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
We have defined a new term @lquotes@;representation item,@rquotes@;
which includes @Chg{New=[all representation clauses],
Old=[@nt{representation_clause}s]} and representation pragmas, as well as
@nt<component_clause>s.
This is convenient because the rules are almost identical for all @Chg{New=[of them],
Old=[three]}. @Chg{New=[We have also defined the new terms
@lquotes@;operational item@rquotes@; and @lquotes@;operational aspects@rquotes@;
in order to conveniently handle new types of @Chg{Version=[2],New=[specifiable],Old=[specifable]} entities.],Old=[]}

All of the forcing occurrence stuff has been moved into its own
subclause (see @RefSecNum{Freezing Rules}),
and rewritten to use the term @lquotes@;freezing@rquotes@;.

RM83-13.1(10) requires implementation-defined restrictions on
representation items to be enforced at compile time.
However, that is impossible in some cases.
If the user specifies a junk (nonstatic) address in an address
clause, and the implementation chooses to detect the error (for example,
using hardware memory management with protected pages), then it's
clearly going to be a run-time error.
It seems silly to call that @lquotes@;semantics@rquotes@; rather than
@lquotes@;a restriction.@rquotes@;

RM83-13.1(10) tries to pretend that @ntf{representation_clause}s don't affect
the semantics of the program.
One counter-example is the Small clause.
Ada 95 has more counter-examples.
We have noted the opposite above.

Some of the more stringent requirements are moved to
@RefSec{Required Representation Support}.

  or @nt{generic_instantiation} the @nt{aspect_specification} goes at the end of
  the declaration; it is then more visible and less likely to interfere with the
  layout of the rest of the structure. However, we make an exception for program
  units (other than subprogram specifications) and bodies, in which the
  @nt{aspect_specification} goes before the @key[is]. In these cases, the entity
  could be large and could contain other declarations that also have
  @nt{aspect_specification}s, so it is better to put the
  @nt{aspect_specification} toward the top of the declaration. (Some aspects @en
  such as Pure @en also affect the legality of the contents of a unit, so it
  would be annoying to only see those after reading the entire unit.)]}

@begin{Reason}
  Aliased objects are the ones for which the
  Unchecked_Access attribute is allowed;
  hence, these have to be allocated on an addressable
  boundary anyway. Similar considerations apply to objects
  of a by-reference type.

  An implementation need not go to any trouble
  to make Address work in other cases.
  For example, if an object X is not aliased and not of a by-reference type,
  and the implementation chooses to store it in a register,
  X'Address might return System.Null_Address
  (assuming registers are not addressable).
  For a subprogram whose calling convention is Intrinsic,
  or for a package,
  the implementation need not generate an out-of-line
  piece of code for it.

An implementation should support Address clauses for
imported subprograms.

@begin{MetaRules}
By default, the Alignment of a subtype should
reflect the @lquotes@;natural@rquotes@; alignment for objects of the
subtype on the machine.
The Alignment, whether specified or default,
should be known at compile time, even though
Addresses are generally not known at compile
time.
(The generated code should never need to check
at run time the number of zero bits at the end
of an address to determine an alignment).

There are two symmetric purposes of Alignment clauses, depending on
whether or not the implementation has control over object
allocation.
If the implementation allocates an object,
the implementation should ensure that
the Address and Alignment are consistent with
each other.
If something outside the implementation allocates an
object, the implementation should be allowed to
assume that the Address and Alignment are
consistent, but should not assume stricter alignments
than that.

want to force an Alignment stricter than the parameter's subtype.
For example, on some systems, it is customary to always align
parameters to 4 storage elements.

Hence, one might initially assume that the implementation could
evilly make all Alignments 1 by default, even though integers, say,
are normally aligned on a 4-storage-element boundary. However, the
implementation cannot get away with that @em if the Alignment is 1,
the generated code cannot assume an Alignment of 4, at least not for
objects allocated outside the control of the implementation.

Of course implementations can assume anything they can prove, but
typically an implementation will be unable to prove much about the
alignment of, say, an imported object. Furthermore, the information
about where an address @lquotes@;came from@rquotes@; can be lost to the compiler due to
separate compilation.

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
The Alignment of an object that is a component of a packed
composite object will usually be 0, to indicate that the component is
not necessarily aligned on a storage element boundary.
For a subtype, an Alignment of 0 means that objects of the subtype are
not normally aligned on a storage element boundary at all.
For example, an implementation might choose to make Component_Size be
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[1],Old=[0]}
for an array of Booleans, even
when @Chg{Version=[3],New=[the],Old=[@nt{pragma}]} Pack
@Chg{Version=[3],New=[aspect ],Old=[]}has not been
specified for the array.
In this case, Boolean'Alignment would be 0.
(In the presence of tasking, this would in general be feasible only on a
machine that had atomic test-bit and set-bit instructions.)

If the machine has no particular natural alignments, then all subtype
Alignments will probably be 1 by default.

Specifying an Alignment of 0 in an @nt{attribute_definition_clause} does
not require the implementation to do anything (except return 0 when the
Alignment is queried).
However, it might be taken as advice on some implementations.

It is an error for an Address clause to disobey the object's Alignment.
The error cannot be detected at compile time, in general, because the
Address is not necessarily known at compile time (and is almost
certainly not static). We do not require a runtime check, since
efficiency seems paramount here, and Address clauses are treading on
thin ice anyway. Hence, this misuse of Address clauses is just like any
other misuse of Address clauses @em it's erroneous.

A type extension can have a stricter Alignment than its parent.
This can happen, for example, if the Alignment of the parent is 4,
but the extension contains a component with Alignment 8.
The Alignment of a class-wide type or object will have to be the
maximum possible Alignment of any extension.

The recommended level of support for the Alignment attribute is
intended to reflect a minimum useful set of capabilities. An
implementation can assume that all Alignments are multiples of each
other @em 1, 2, 4, and 8 might be the only supported Alignments for
subtypes. An Alignment of 3 or 6 is unlikely to be useful.
For objects that can be allocated statically, we recommend that
the implementation support larger alignments, such as 4096. We do
not recommend such large alignments for subtypes, because the maximum
subtype alignment will also have to be used as the alignment of stack
frames, heap objects, and class-wide objects. Similarly, we do not
recommend such large alignments for stack-allocated objects.

If the maximum default Alignment is 8
(say, Long_Float'Alignment = 8),
then the implementation can refuse to accept stricter alignments
for subtypes. This simplifies the generated code, since the compiler
can align the stack and class-wide types to this maximum without a
substantial waste of space (or time).

Note that the recommended level of support takes into account
interactions between Size and Alignment. For example, on a 32-bit
machine with 8-bit storage elements, where load and store
instructions have to be aligned according to the size of the thing
being loaded or stored, the implementation might accept an Alignment
of 1 if the Size is 8, but might reject an Alignment of 1 if the Size
is 32. On a machine where unaligned loads and stores are merely
inefficient (as opposed to causing hardware traps),
we would expect an Alignment of 1 to be supported for any Size.

@end{Reason}

@Leading@PDefn2{Term=[recommended level of support], Sec=(Size attribute)}
The recommended level of support for the Size attribute
of subtypes is:
@begin{Itemize}

The Size (if not specified) of a static discrete or fixed point subtype
should be the number of bits needed to represent each value belonging to
the subtype using an unbiased representation,
leaving space for a sign bit only if the subtype contains negative
values.
If such a subtype is a first subtype,
then an implementation should support a specified Size for it that
reflects this representation.

@begin{ImplNote}
  This applies to static enumeration subtypes,
  using the internal codes used to represent the values.

  For a two's-complement machine, this implies that
  for a static signed integer subtype S,
  if all values of S are in the range 0 .. 2@+{@i{n}}@en@;1,
  or all values of S are in the range @en@;2@+{@i{n@en@;1}} .. 2@+{@i{n@en@;1}}@en@;1,
  for some @i{n} less than or equal to the word size,
  then S'Size should be <= the smallest such @i{n}.
  For a one's-complement machine,
  it is the same except that in the second range,
  the lower bound @lquotes@;@en@;2@+{@i{n@en@;1}}@rquotes@; is replaced by @lquotes@;@en@;2@+{@i{n@en@;1}}+1@rquotes@;.


  If an integer subtype (whether signed or unsigned)
  contains no negative values, the Size should not include space
  for a sign bit.


  Typically, the implementation will choose to make the Size of a
  subtype be exactly the smallest such @i{n}.
  However, it might, for example, choose a biased representation,
  in which case it could choose a smaller value.

@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
  On most machines, it is in general not a good idea to pack (parts of)
  multiple stand-alone objects into the same storage element,
  because (1) it usually doesn't save much space,
  and (2) it requires locking to prevent tasks from interfering with each
  other, since separate stand-alone objects are independently
  addressable.
  Therefore, if S'Size = 2
  on a machine with 8-bit storage elements,
  the size of a stand-alone object of subtype S will probably not be 2.
  It might, for example, be 8, 16 or 32, depending on the availability
  and efficiency of various machine instructions.
  The same applies to components of composite types,
  unless @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Pack],Old=[packing]},
  Component_Size, or record layout is specified.

  For an unconstrained discriminated object,
  if the implementation allocates the maximum
  possible size,
  then the Size attribute should return that maximum
  possible size.
@end{ImplNote}
  @begin{Ramification}
  The Size of an object X is not usually the same as that of
  its subtype S.
  If X is a stand-alone object or a parameter, for example,
  most implementations will round X'Size up to a storage
  element boundary, or more, so X'Size might be greater than S'Size.
  On the other hand,
  X'Size cannot be less than S'Size, even
  if the implementation can prove, for example,
  that the range of values actually taken on by X during execution
  is smaller than the range of S.

  For example, if S is a first integer subtype whose range
  is 0..3, S'Size will be probably be 2 bits, and components of
  packed composite types of this subtype will be 2 bits
  (assuming Storage_Unit is a multiple of 2),
  but stand-alone objects and parameters will probably
  not have a size of 2 bits; they might be rounded up to
  32 bits, for example.
  On the other hand, Unchecked_Conversion will use the 2-bit size,
  even when converting a stand-alone object,
  as one would expect.

  Another reason for making the Size of an object bigger than
  its subtype's Size is to support the run-time detection of
  uninitialized variables.
@PDefn{uninitialized variables}
  The implementation might add an extra value to a discrete subtype
  that represents the uninitialized state,
  and check for this value on use.
  In some cases, the extra value will require an extra bit in the
  representation of the object.
  Such detection is not required by the language.
  If it is provided, the implementation has to be able to turn it off.
  For example, if the programmer gives a
  @nt{record_representation_clause} or Component_Size clause that makes
  a component too small to allow the extra bit,
  then the implementation will not be able to perform the checking
  (not using this method, anyway).

  @Leading@;The fact that the size of an object is not necessarily the same
  as its subtype can be confusing:
  @begin{Example}
@key[type] Device_Register @key[is] @key[range] 0..2**8 - 1;
@key[for] Device_Register'Size @key[use] 8; --@RI{ Confusing!}
My_Device : Device_Register;
@key[for] My_Device'Address @key[use] To_Address(16#FF00#);
  @end{Example}

  The programmer might think that My_Device'Size is 8,
  and that My_Device'Address points at an 8-bit location.
  However, this is not true.
  In Ada 83 (and in Ada 95), My_Device'Size might well be 32,
  and My_Device'Address might well point at the high-order 8 bits of
  the 32-bit object, which are always all zero bits.
  If My_Device'Address is passed to an assembly language subprogram,
  based on the programmer's assumption,
  the program will not work properly.
  @end{Ramification}
  @begin{Reason}
  It is not reasonable to require that an implementation allocate
  exactly 8 bits to all objects of subtype Device_Register.
  For example, in many run-time models, stand-alone objects
  and parameters are always aligned to a word boundary.
  Such run-time models are generally based on hardware considerations
  that are beyond the control of the implementer.
  (It is reasonable to require that an implementation allocate exactly
  8 bits to all components of subtype Device_Register, if packed.)
  @end{Reason}
  @begin{Ramification}
  @Leading@;The correct way to write the above code is like this:
  @begin{Example}
@key[type] Device_Register @key[is] @key[range] 0..2**8 - 1;
My_Device : Device_Register;
@key[for] My_Device'Size @key[use] 8;
@key[for] My_Device'Address @key[use] To_Address(16#FF00#);
  @end{Example}

  If the implementation cannot accept 8-bit stand-alone objects,
  then this will be illegal.
  However, on a machine where an 8-bit device register exists,
  the implementation will probably be able to accept 8-bit stand-alone
  objects. Therefore, My_Device'Size will be 8,
  and My_Device'Address will point at those 8 bits,
  as desired.

  If an object of subtype Device_Register is passed to a foreign
  language subprogram, it will be passed according to that subprogram's
  conventions. Most foreign language implementations have similar
  run-time model restrictions.
  For example, when passing to a C function,
  where the argument is of
  the C type char* (that is, pointer to char),
  the C compiler will generally expect a full word value,
  either on the stack, or in a register.
  It will @i{not} expect a single byte.
  Thus, Size clauses for subtypes really have nothing to do with
  passing parameters to foreign language subprograms.
  @end{Ramification}

For a subtype implemented with levels of indirection,
the Size should include the size of the pointers,
but not the size of what they point at.
@begin{Ramification}
For example, if a task object is represented as a pointer to some
information (including a task stack), then the size of the object
should be the size of the pointer.
The Storage_Size, on the other hand,
should include the size of the stack.

An implementation should support specified Component_Sizes that

For such Component_Sizes, the array should contain no gaps between
components.
For other Component_Sizes (if supported), the array should
contain no gaps between components when

same in two different partitions.}
@begin{Reason}
  These requirements are important because external tags are used
  for input/output of class-wide types. These requirements ensure
  that what is written by one program can be read back by some other
  program so long as they share the same declaration for the
  type (and everything it depends on).

  The user may specify the external tag if (s)he wishes its value
  to be stable even across changes to the compilation unit
  in which the type is declared (or changes in some unit on which it
  depends).

  @ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
  We use a String rather than a @Chg{Version=[2],
  New=[Stream_Element_Array],Old=[Storage_Array]} to represent an
  external tag for portability.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Ramification}
  Note that the characters
  of an external tag need not all be graphic characters.
  In other words, the external tag can be a sequence of arbitrary
  8-bit bytes.

The following language-defined attributes are specifiable,
at least for some of the kinds of entities to which they apply:
Address,
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[Size, Component_Size, ]}Alignment,
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Bit_Order, Component_Size, ],Old=[]}
External_Tag,
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Input, Machine_Radix, Output, Read, Size, ],Old=[]}
Small, @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[Bit_Order, ]}
Storage_Pool, Storage_Size,
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[Stream_Size, and ],Old=[]}
Write@Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[, Output, Read,
Input, and Machine_Radix]}.

It follows from the general rules in @RefSecNum{Operational and Representation Aspects}
that if one writes @lquotes@;@key[for] X'Size @key[use] Y;@rquotes@; then
the X'Size @nt{attribute_reference} will return Y
(assuming the implementation allows the Size clause).
The same is true for all of the specifiable attributes except Storage_Size.
@begin{Ramification}
An implementation may specify that an implementation-defined attribute is
specifiable for certain entities.
This follows from the fact that the semantics of
implementation-defined attributes is implementation defined.
An implementation is not allowed to make a language-defined attribute
specifiable if it isn't.

For nonboolean enumeration types,

  This default representation is already used by all known

  an enumeration representation clause that is equivalent
  to this default rule.
@end{Reason}
@begin{Discussion}
  For boolean types, it is relatively common to use all ones for
  True, and all zeros for False, since some hardware supports
  that directly. Of course, for a one-bit Boolean object

  is presumably one (choosing the reverse would be extremely

The recommended level of support for @nt{enumeration_representation_clause}s is:

An implementation should support at least the internal codes in the

@nt{enumeration_@!representation_@!clause}s for boolean types.

@begin{Reason}
The benefits of specifying the internal coding of a boolean type do
not outweigh the implementation costs.

@ChgAdded{Version=[2],Text=[An implementation should support machine scalars

An implementation should support storage places that can be extracted
with a load, mask, shift sequence of machine code,
and set with a load, shift, mask, store sequence,
given the available machine instructions and run-time model.

A storage place should be supported if its size is equal to the Size
of the component subtype,
and it starts and ends on a boundary that obeys the Alignment of the
component subtype.

storage place that does not cross an aligned word boundary should be supported.

@begin{Reason}
The above recommendations are sufficient to
define interfaces to most interesting hardware.
This causes less implementation burden than the definition in ACID,
which requires arbitrary bit alignments of arbitrarily large
components.
Since the ACID definition is neither enforced by the ACVC,

it seems OK for us to weaken it.

An implementation may reserve a storage place for the tag
field of a tagged type, and disallow other components from overlapping
that place.
@begin{Ramification}
Similar permission for other dope is not granted.
@end{Ramification}

An implementation need not support a
@nt{component_clause} for a component of an extension part
if the storage place is not after the storage places of all components
of the parent type, whether or not those storage places had been specified.
@begin{Reason}
These restrictions are probably necessary if block equality
operations are to be feasible for class-wide types.
For block comparison to work, the implementation typically has to fill
in any gaps with zero (or one) bits.
If a @lquotes@;gap@rquotes@; in the parent type is filled in with a component in a
type extension, then this won't work when a class-wide object is
passed by reference, as is required.

@end{ImplAdvice}

@begin{Notes}
If no @nt{component_clause} is given for a component, then the
choice of the storage place for the component is left to the
implementation. If @nt{component_clause}s are given for all components,
the @nt{record_representation_clause} completely specifies the
representation of the type and will be obeyed exactly by the
implementation.
@begin{Ramification}
The
visibility rules prevent the name of a component of the type from
appearing in a @nt{record_representation_clause} at any place
@i{except} for the @SynI{component_}@nt<local_name> of a
@nt{component_clause}.
However, since the @nt{record_representation_clause} is part of the
declarative region of the type declaration,
the component names hide outer homographs throughout.

@ChgRef{Version=[1],Kind=[Revised],Ref=[8652/0009],ARef=[AI95-00137-01]}
A @nt{record_representation_clause} cannot be given for a protected type,
even though protected types, like record types, have components.
The primary reason for this rule is that there is likely to be too
much dope in a protected type @em entry queues,
bit maps for barrier values, etc.
In order to control the representation of the user-defined components, simply
declare a record type, give it a
@Chg{New=[@nt{record_@!representation_@!clause}],Old=[@nt{representation_clause}]},
and give the protected type one component whose type is the record type.
Alternatively, if the protected object is protecting something like a
device register, it makes more sense to keep the thing being
protected outside the protected object (possibly with a pointer to it
in the protected object), in order to keep implementation-defined
components out of the way.

For discontiguous components, these attributes make no sense.

It is not intended to fully support data interoperability across
different machines,

@ChgRef{Version=[2],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI95-00114-01]}
We can't require all implementations on a given machine to use the same
bit ordering by default;
if the user cares, a @Chg{Version=[2],New=[],Old=[@nt{pragma} ]}Bit_Order
@Chg{Version=[2],New=[@nt{attribute_definition_clause} ],Old=[]}can be used

A bit ordering is a method of interpreting the meaning of the
storage place attributes.
@Defn{High_Order_First}
@Defn{big endian}
@Defn2{Term=[endian], Sec=(big)}
High_Order_First @Redundant[(known in the vernacular as @lquotes@;big endian@rquotes@;)]
means that the first bit of a storage element
(bit 0) is the most significant bit (interpreting the sequence of
bits that represent a component as an unsigned integer value).
@Defn{Low_Order_First}
@Defn{little endian}
@Defn2{Term=[endian], Sec=(little)}
Low_Order_First @Redundant[(known in the vernacular as @lquotes@;little endian@rquotes@;)]

If Word_Size = Storage_Unit,
the default bit ordering is implementation defined.
If Word_Size > Storage_Unit,
the default bit ordering is the same as the ordering of storage
elements in a word, when interpreted as an
integer.
@IndexSee{Term=[byte sex],See=(ordering of storage elements in a word)}
@ImplDef{If Word_Size = Storage_Unit,
the default bit ordering.}
@begin{Ramification}
Consider machines whose Word_Size = 32,
and whose Storage_Unit = 8.
Assume the default bit ordering applies.
On a machine with big-endian addresses,
the most significant storage element of an integer is at the address of
the integer.
Therefore, bit zero of a storage element is the most significant bit.
On a machine with little-endian addresses,
the least significant storage element of an integer is at the address of
the integer.
Therefore, bit zero of a storage element is the least significant
bit.
@end{Ramification}

The storage place attributes of a
component of a type are
interpreted according to the bit ordering
of the type.
@begin{Ramification}
This implies that the interpretation of the @nt{position},
@nt{first_bit}, and @nt{last_bit} of a @nt{component_clause} of a
@nt{record_representation_clause} obey the bit ordering given in a
representation item.

@LabeledClause{Change of Representation}

@begin{Intro}
@ChgRef{Version=[3],Kind=[Revised],ARef=[AI05-0229-1]}
@redundant[@Defn{change of representation}
@Defn2{Term=[representation], Sec=(change of)}
A @nt{type_conversion} (see @RefSecNum{Type Conversions})
can be used to convert between two different
representations of the same array or record.
To convert an array from one representation to another,
two array types need to be declared with
matching component subtypes, and convertible index types.
If one type has @Chg{Version=[3],New=[Pack],Old=[packing]}
specified and the other does not,
then explicit conversion can be used to pack or unpack an array.

To convert a record from one representation to another,
two record types with a common ancestor type need to be declared,
with no inherited subprograms. Distinct representations can then
be specified for the record types, and explicit conversion between
the types can be used to effect a change in representation.]
@begin{Ramification}
This technique does not work if the first type is an
untagged type with user-defined primitive subprograms.
It does not work at all for tagged types.
@end{Ramification}

--@RI{ Packed_Descriptor and Descriptor are two different types}

    @key[record]
      --@RI{ components of a descriptor}

    @key[record]
      --@RI{ component clauses for some or for all components}
    @key[end] @key[record];
